this web development with python course,0.0,4.68
is broken up into two parts in the first,1.979,4.261
part you will learn how to build and,4.68,4.32
deploy a site using the flask python web,6.24,5.279
framework in part two you will connect,9.0,4.62
the flask application from the first,11.519,5.401
part to a cloud mySQL database and learn,13.62,4.86
how to deploy a production-ready,16.92,4.5
database driven web application Akash,18.48,5.4
created this course he is the CEO of,21.42,4.859
Jovian and he has created many popular,23.88,3.78
courses,26.279,4.441
hi I'm Akash co-founder and CEO of,27.66,5.579
jovial today I am really excited to,30.72,4.32
share with you this practical and,33.239,4.201
Hands-On introduction to web development,35.04,4.98
with python from scratch in this,37.44,4.56
tutorial you will watch me build and,40.02,4.8
deploy a jovian careers website to the,42.0,6.059
cloud using free online resources you,44.82,5.399
can follow along to build your own,48.059,5.34
personal website so let's get started we,50.219,5.401
want to explore web development and,53.399,4.081
deployment using Python and its,55.62,3.419
ecosystem of libraries,57.48,4.98
and we will do this by creating a jovian,59.039,6.601
careers website where we can list job,62.46,6.06
openings at Jovian and people can apply,65.64,5.4
to those jobs so after this lesson you,68.52,4.919
should be in a position to build and,71.04,4.86
deploy your own website maybe a personal,73.439,4.561
website a portfolio or some sample,75.9,4.56
application,78.0,5.4
there are no prerequisites here apart,80.46,5.4
from Python and git,83.4,4.38
so here are some of the topics that we,85.86,3.119
are going to look at we're going to look,87.78,3.54
at how to use GitHub for creating a,88.979,5.28
project and replit for working on a,91.32,5.759
project we will talk about the flask web,94.259,4.561
framework which is used to create web,97.079,4.261
applications in Python we will touch on,98.82,5.7
HTML and CSS we will talk about the,101.34,5.76
bootstrap framework which will help us,104.52,4.68
make our website look a little better,107.1,5.4
with less effort and then we will talk,109.2,5.82
about deployment on cloud platforms,112.5,4.38
specifically we are going to deploy to,115.02,4.26
render.com and finally we will talk,116.88,4.559
about how to set up your own custom,119.28,5.28
domain and configure it to point it to,121.439,4.68
the website that you have created and,124.56,3.36
deployed,126.119,4.56
the first step is to create a project on,127.92,4.98
GitHub now GitHub as you might already,130.679,5.64
know is a platform for sharing and,132.9,5.58
collaborating on software development,136.319,4.741
projects and it is powered by git which,138.48,4.56
is a version control system which lets,141.06,4.319
you record every version of your project,143.04,4.8
as you make changes,145.379,3.901
so the first thing you want to do is go,147.84,4.08
to github.com and then sign in or create,149.28,3.9
an account if you haven't done that,151.92,2.28
already,153.18,3.0
and once you're logged into github.com,154.2,5.34
this is the screen that you will see but,156.18,5.1
in this busy interface what you're,159.54,4.26
looking for is this new button this is,161.28,4.739
the new repository or new project button,163.8,3.96
if you don't see this new button there's,166.019,3.781
also a plus button here on the top right,167.76,4.92
which you can use and just select new,169.8,5.34
Repository,172.68,4.5
now once you try to create a new,175.14,4.08
repository you will have to select an,177.18,4.32
owner which will be your GitHub account,179.22,4.98
your GitHub username and then we need to,181.5,5.7
give this repository a name so this has,184.2,4.92
to be one or more lowercase words,187.2,4.38
separated by hyphens so I'm going to,189.12,4.199
call it Jovian,191.58,5.46
careers website,193.319,3.721
and we can give this a description if we,197.099,4.92
want so I'm just going to say a careers,199.2,6.0
website for Joven,202.019,5.341
and I'm going to make this public so,205.2,4.38
that anybody can access it,207.36,4.56
and I'm also going to add a readme file,209.58,4.019
because this will initialize the,211.92,3.239
repository so I don't have to push,213.599,3.06
anything to the repository to get,215.159,2.94
started,216.659,3.0
and then I'm also going to add a git,218.099,4.441
ignore file so as we do our development,219.659,5.64
a lot of build files and compiled files,222.54,4.74
and intermediate files are created by,225.299,4.8
python which we may not want to put into,227.28,4.739
git because they are not actual source,230.099,3.481
code they are simply used to run the,232.019,4.201
code so to ignore all of these,233.58,4.5
intermediate output files that are,236.22,4.56
created you can select a DOT get ignore,238.08,5.7
file that can get added to the root of,240.78,4.98
your repository now depending on the,243.78,3.48
kind of project you're working on the,245.76,3.78
kind of language you're using the kind,247.26,4.38
of files that you need to exclude May,249.54,4.8
differ so GitHub has already provided a,251.64,6.059
git ignore template for Python and we,254.34,5.1
just select that so that we don't,257.699,3.6
accidentally end up adding any,259.44,3.78
intermediate compiled files or output,261.299,5.041
files into our Repository,263.22,5.16
and finally if you're making your,266.34,3.96
repository public it's always a good,268.38,3.84
idea to include a license which lets,270.3,3.72
others know how they can use it whether,272.22,3.12
they can use it commercially whether,274.02,3.3
they can build on top of it or not and,275.34,3.6
I'm just going to select the MIT license,277.32,3.54
here which is the most liberal license,278.94,3.6
that's available,280.86,3.839
and that's it now we can create the,282.54,4.7
Repository,284.699,2.541
so now the repository is created and you,287.46,4.56
can see here it contains a readme file,290.04,4.439
which is rendered as markdown so it just,292.02,4.619
contains the name of the repository it,294.479,3.66
also contains a license file that you,296.639,3.06
can read and it contains a DOT get,298.139,4.321
ignore file if you click on it contains,299.699,4.681
information about the kind of files that,302.46,4.44
should be excluded,304.38,4.98
from git and these are all the,306.9,3.84
intermediate files that might get,309.36,4.02
created when you're running your python,310.74,4.14
code,313.38,4.2
so let's go back here and take this,314.88,5.46
the next step is to open up this project,317.58,5.399
on the platform replit.com,320.34,5.76
so here this project is on GitHub GitHub,322.979,5.16
can be used to store projects can be,326.1,4.26
used to share projects but cannot be,328.139,5.28
used to develop projects,330.36,5.46
now that's where you might want to use,333.419,5.101
this Cloud platform called replet and,335.82,5.159
replit.com is an online free,338.52,5.94
collaborative in browser IDE refers to,340.979,5.521
integrated development environment so,344.46,4.2
what that means is it can connect to,346.5,4.44
your GitHub account and it can let you,348.66,5.759
write code on the cloud and you don't,350.94,4.979
have to install anything on your,354.419,4.201
computer and your code will be synced to,355.919,4.441
the cloud and you can access it from,358.62,3.24
anywhere,360.36,4.86
so you can go to replied.com and you can,361.86,5.76
then sign up or log into replit so I'm,365.22,3.9
just going to log in because I already,367.62,4.16
have an account,369.12,2.66
and once you log in this will bring you,372.84,4.56
to your replay dashboard,375.12,4.5
now here you can create new projects but,377.4,4.98
ideally you want to use GitHub to keep,379.62,4.44
track of your projects so you can scroll,382.38,4.28
down here,384.06,2.6
and you can click on connect GitHub,392.16,5.759
so let's click connect GitHub and here,394.68,6.12
you might want to then select what,397.919,4.921
exactly you want to give replied access,400.8,4.44
to so in my case I'm going to click on,402.84,4.859
my name and I can choose to authorize,405.24,4.739
all the repositories I have so that any,407.699,4.201
repository I have on GitHub I can,409.979,4.44
develop with replit or I can choose to,411.9,4.56
only give access to select repositories,414.419,4.381
now in this case I'm just going to give,416.46,4.079
access to select repositories because I,418.8,3.839
have a whole bunch of repositories so,420.539,5.641
let's see Jovian couriers website okay,422.639,6.361
that looks great and these are the,426.18,4.44
permissions that replied is going to get,429.0,3.9
it is going to be able to read the code,430.62,3.84
from GitHub and it is going to be able,432.9,3.96
to write code back into GitHub,434.46,5.88
so let's install and authorize,436.86,6.119
and that should now bring us to the,440.34,4.56
replit dashboard and now you should see,442.979,4.44
a GitHub Repose section on your applet,444.9,5.16
dashboard and here you can see whichever,447.419,4.381
repositories you've selected replied,450.06,3.24
will have access here,451.8,3.42
so let me now click on this and let me,453.3,4.5
see what happens so now it's going to,455.22,6.0
import this repository so that means all,457.8,6.06
the code from GitHub and I'm going to,461.22,4.86
make this Rebel public so just like my,463.86,3.959
repository is public I also want to make,466.08,4.679
my replit project public and,467.819,6.72
let me then click import from GitHub,470.759,5.641
and that's going to load up all the,474.539,3.78
files that we had seen here git ignore,476.4,4.26
license and readme.md,478.319,4.081
and it's now going to show these files,480.66,4.439
on replit,482.4,5.34
now everything you build will ultimately,485.099,6.5
have to be run in a certain way,487.74,3.859
so you can configure a run command and,493.56,5.579
every time you click this run button the,496.56,4.56
Run command that you configure here is,499.139,4.201
going to be executed and the output is,501.12,4.079
going to be shown here in this console,503.34,5.34
tab I'm going to type python app dot pi,505.199,6.381
as the command that will be executed,508.68,5.88
when the Run button is clicked so I'm,511.58,5.199
going to click done and this is going to,514.56,5.7
create a file called Dot replit,516.779,6.241
within the repository which contains,520.26,5.28
this information and informs replit this,523.02,5.1
is a Python 3 project and the Run button,525.54,6.299
should run python app.pi now you may,528.12,5.64
notice that this dot replied file is not,531.839,4.56
visible here and that's because it is a,533.76,4.68
hidden file so you can just click on,536.399,3.901
these three dots and say show hidden,538.44,4.079
files and that's going to show the dot,540.3,4.68
replet file which is just hidden from,542.519,5.281
you by default so now we have this,544.98,4.62
project open on replit you can see here,547.8,4.32
we have a files sidebar the file sidebar,549.6,3.96
contains a list of files that are,552.12,3.24
present this is the same get ignore file,553.56,3.899
we had this is the same license file we,555.36,3.96
had and this is the same readme file we,557.459,2.641
had,559.32,3.12
and we can choose to then show a preview,560.1,4.2
which is shown here or we can hide the,562.44,3.12
preview,564.3,4.56
so that's the files tab and here is the,565.56,5.279
file editor this is where we can edit,568.86,4.32
the code and finally here we have two,570.839,5.521
things we have a console which shows the,573.18,5.279
output of the Run button,576.36,4.919
and we have a shell which is just like a,578.459,4.32
terminal or a command line interface,581.279,3.261
where you can run any command line,582.779,6.12
utilities like LS or PWD or CD or,584.54,6.82
whatever you want to do let me click the,588.899,4.921
Run button and see what happens,591.36,4.86
and the first thing it does is it tries,593.82,4.74
to run the command Python app.pi and it,596.22,4.26
says that python cannot open the file,598.56,4.02
app.pi because there is no such file or,600.48,4.2
directory we have not created the file,602.58,3.36
yet,604.68,3.719
so I'm just going to click plus here to,605.94,4.44
create a new file and I'm going to call,608.399,5.181
it app.pi,610.38,3.2
and let's just print,613.8,5.52
hello world here,616.8,5.28
and let's run it,619.32,4.92
and now you can see that the code was,622.08,4.68
executed Python app.pi and hello world,624.24,4.56
the output was displayed here,626.76,5.759
so now we have got our project imported,628.8,6.3
into replit and we are now already,632.519,4.38
developing it we can open up files we,635.1,3.359
can change the code and then we can run,636.899,3.661
the code and of course we don't have to,638.459,3.661
use the Run button we can come in here,640.56,4.86
and we can say python app dot pi and,642.12,6.839
that will work perfectly fine as well,645.42,6.18
so let's take that we've now opened up a,648.959,4.041
project on replit,651.6,4.32
now we are not here to print hello world,653.0,4.779
we are here to build a web application,655.92,4.44
and for building web applications in,657.779,6.24
Python we use a framework called flask,660.36,5.94
so if you just go online and search for,664.019,5.401
flask python,666.3,4.62
you will be taken to this website,669.42,4.26
flask.palletsproject.com,670.92,5.76
flask is one of the most popular web,673.68,5.339
Frameworks in Python,676.68,4.58
and flask is actually really easy to use,679.019,5.221
and let's check the installation and the,681.26,5.139
quick start sections to understand how,684.24,3.3
to use it,686.399,3.901
every Library you come across will have,687.54,4.44
some sort of an installation and quick,690.3,3.3
start or getting started section or,691.98,3.12
maybe a quick tutorial that you can,693.6,2.52
follow,695.1,4.44
so installation simply requires us to,696.12,5.399
run so here it says create an,699.54,4.62
environment Etc we're not too interested,701.519,4.201
in all that right now because we're,704.16,3.84
already using a cloud environment but,705.72,4.679
within the activated environment use the,708.0,4.2
following command to install flasks so,710.399,3.18
this is what we need to do we need to,712.2,3.96
run pip install flask so I'm going to go,713.579,4.741
here I'm going to go into the shell not,716.16,4.08
the console because the console is just,718.32,4.98
tied to the Run button but the shell and,720.24,6.12
I am going to run pip,723.3,4.74
install,726.36,4.32
flask,728.04,4.799
and that's going to now install flask,730.68,6.3
for us now we can go back into the flask,732.839,6.721
tutorial and now we can head into the,736.98,3.84
Quick Start,739.56,4.5
and here is what a simplest possible web,740.82,6.12
application in flask looks like so here,744.06,4.56
there are two things this is the module,746.94,3.899
so when we set pip install flask the,748.62,4.32
module with the name flask got installed,750.839,4.74
and modules always have lower case names,752.94,6.899
so from flask and then we say import and,755.579,7.021
from the flask module we want to import,759.839,5.881
the flask class even though these both,762.6,5.039
are called flask it's a bit confusingly,765.72,4.559
named but inside the module flask there,767.639,6.421
is a class called flask with a capital f,770.279,8.041
so I'm going to import flask and now,774.06,7.2
we need to create an app an app is,778.32,5.94
simply an object of the class flask okay,781.26,5.22
so python has something called object,784.26,5.1
oriented programming built inside it and,786.48,4.5
what we are doing here is we are,789.36,3.36
importing a class and then we are,790.98,4.08
creating an object of the class now if,792.72,3.66
that doesn't make sense don't worry,795.06,3.719
about it all we are doing here is,796.38,5.28
importing functionality from flask and,798.779,5.401
putting it into this variable called app,801.66,4.679
so we are creating a flask application,804.18,4.26
by typing flask,806.339,4.921
this way now the only thing that we need,808.44,6.06
to add here is a name every time you,811.26,4.56
create a flask application you have to,814.5,4.44
give it a name and typically inside any,815.82,5.579
python script you already have this,818.94,4.62
variable called underscore underscore,821.399,5.101
name underscore underscore Define if I,823.56,5.219
for example just type print underscore,826.5,3.779
underscore name underscore underscore,828.779,3.661
and run it,830.279,3.901
you're going to see here that it prints,832.44,3.42
underscore underscore main underscore,834.18,3.959
underscore the name variable refers to,835.86,5.039
how a particular script was invoked if,838.139,6.241
it was invoked using python app.pi the,840.899,4.981
name variable is going to have the value,844.38,3.12
mean and if it was invoked from,845.88,3.48
somewhere else the name variable may,847.5,4.139
have some other name okay so now we have,849.36,4.68
created a flask application,851.639,4.5
now once we have created a flask,854.04,6.299
application we then need to create a,856.139,5.041
route,860.339,3.481
now any website that you visit,861.18,4.98
you typically access it using some URL,863.82,6.78
for example you may go to jovian.ai,866.16,7.26
and this is the page that is on the URL,870.6,6.06
joven.ai now if I click on profile here,873.42,5.82
you can see that the URL has changed to,876.66,6.0
slash Akash NS and now there is a,879.24,6.0
different page rendered on this URL if I,882.66,4.5
click on learn and click on courses you,885.24,3.539
can see the URL has changed to slash,887.16,4.799
learn and now you see something,888.779,4.92
different on this page,891.959,5.761
so what you need to tell flask is when a,893.699,7.921
certain URL is requested what should be,897.72,4.979
returned,901.62,3.48
so here in the quick start we are first,902.699,5.521
registering a route a route is simply a,905.1,5.28
part of the URL after the domain name so,908.22,4.5
here jobin.ai is the domain name and,910.38,4.079
everything after it is called the path,912.72,5.28
or the route so let's do that let's go,914.459,5.82
and register a route here and the way we,918.0,4.139
do that is we say app,920.279,4.56
with an at character so this is called a,922.139,4.38
decorator in Python it's a slightly,924.839,3.541
Advanced concept that's often used in,926.519,3.901
libraries to provide some Advanced,928.38,5.519
functionality so we say app dot route,930.42,6.359
and then we have to provide which path,933.899,4.74
we want it to match so let's say we,936.779,3.92
deploy this website to,938.639,4.801
jovencareers.com then this is going to,940.699,3.7
match,943.44,3.48
slash which is the empty route which is,944.399,3.841
basically just the home page,946.92,3.18
jovencareers.com,948.24,3.839
and then,950.1,4.62
we Define a function so we can define a,952.079,5.841
function below this decorator,954.72,3.2
hello world,958.38,3.6
and in this function,959.699,4.921
let us simply for now return,961.98,5.34
hello world,964.62,5.04
so what we've done here is we've defined,967.32,4.319
a function which simply Returns the,969.66,4.619
string hello world but by adding this,971.639,4.861
decorator we've informed flask that when,974.279,5.521
the URL slash is accessed,976.5,4.44
then,979.8,3.719
show hello world,980.94,5.399
and let's run that,983.519,6.301
and replied does some setup to manage,986.339,5.461
dependencies on its end so let's just,989.82,3.259
wait for that,991.8,3.719
has its own way of managing python,993.079,4.06
packages so that's why sometimes it,995.519,3.24
takes a second or two but once we run it,997.139,3.781
we see nothing happens,998.759,5.221
so nothing happened because,1000.92,5.82
if you scroll down here you can see here,1003.98,4.919
that they expect you to run things in a,1006.74,4.08
slightly different way what you need to,1008.899,3.481
do is you need to export flask,1010.82,3.78
underscore app equals hello or whatever,1012.38,3.84
is the name of the file here it was,1014.6,4.02
called hello.pi and then you need to,1016.22,3.78
type flask run,1018.62,3.779
so what that means is we may have to go,1020.0,4.38
back into our DOT replete file and,1022.399,4.861
change the code here python app.pi,1024.38,4.98
because flask expects to be run in a,1027.26,3.72
different way,1029.36,4.38
so we need to probably change python,1030.98,4.979
app.pi to flask run and we also need to,1033.74,5.04
add somehow this flask cap command now,1035.959,4.74
that's one way to run it,1038.78,4.86
another way to run it is,1040.699,4.321
something that I'm going to show you,1043.64,3.72
right now I'm going to type if,1045.02,4.5
underscore underscore name underscore,1047.36,4.5
underscore equals underscore underscore,1049.52,4.32
mean underscore underscore,1051.86,4.319
so here what we are saying is if the,1053.84,4.68
variable underscore underscore name has,1056.179,5.281
the value underscore underscore mean and,1058.52,5.46
I'm just checking the equality here,1061.46,4.44
and this is going to be the case when we,1063.98,4.559
run python app dot Pi so,1065.9,4.32
let's say if I just print underscore,1068.539,3.841
name underscore underscore,1070.22,4.14
let me just print,1072.38,5.22
I'm inside the if now,1074.36,5.699
and when we run it it simply says that,1077.6,3.959
underscore unscore name has the value,1080.059,3.781
underscore mean and I'm inside the if,1081.559,5.941
now so here if the script is invoked,1083.84,7.079
using the python command then what we,1087.5,6.78
want to do is say app dot run so we have,1090.919,4.981
created the app but we've not yet run,1094.28,3.48
the app and we don't want to use the,1095.9,3.72
flask run command instead we want to do,1097.76,4.5
it using app.run,1099.62,5.1
and here when you type app.run you will,1102.26,3.9
see some documentation you need to,1104.72,4.02
provide a few options the first one is a,1106.16,6.32
host and it simply says here set this to,1108.74,7.08
0.0.0.0 to run on the local development,1112.48,7.62
server so we type app.run host equals,1115.82,7.62
0.0.0.0 and then we pass debug equals,1120.1,4.6
true,1123.44,3.9
and now we save the file and then we,1124.7,5.06
click run,1127.34,2.42
and now you can see that replit actually,1129.98,4.319
opened up a browser within our browser,1132.08,4.38
so this is a fake browser that replied,1134.299,4.981
has opened up for us,1136.46,5.16
so we have imported flask and then we,1139.28,4.68
have created a flask app a flask,1141.62,4.799
application and then we have registered,1143.96,4.68
a route to the application and finally,1146.419,5.421
we have checked if we are running this,1148.64,6.72
app.pi file as a script as python app.pi,1151.84,7.36
then we want to start the app by using,1155.36,6.84
app.run and we want to run it on 0.0.0.0,1159.2,4.92
this is always something that you have,1162.2,4.92
to put in so that it runs locally and we,1164.12,5.28
said debug equals true so that every,1167.12,4.02
time we make a change like if I change,1169.4,3.42
this to hello,1171.14,3.539
Jovian,1172.82,3.78
that's going to now change to hello,1174.679,3.12
Jovian,1176.6,3.66
and just like that we have created our,1177.799,5.041
first web application,1180.26,4.919
you'll see here that this is a browser,1182.84,4.38
that replied is showing us just for the,1185.179,3.36
preview sake but you can also open up,1187.22,4.079
this browser in a new tab and that shows,1188.539,4.321
you hello Jovian and you can see that,1191.299,3.74
this is deployed at this location,1192.86,4.819
joviancareers website dot akashness,1195.039,6.281
rebel.co so this is one of the benefits,1197.679,6.041
of working with replit that you can take,1201.32,3.96
the work that you're doing and you can,1203.72,3.6
share it with other people even while,1205.28,4.56
you are developing it replied is not,1207.32,4.44
great for production workloads so you,1209.84,3.24
should not be sending a lot of traffic,1211.76,3.659
to this site and in fact specifically,1213.08,3.959
here it tells you that this is a,1215.419,3.241
development server don't use it in,1217.039,4.26
production but it is great for testing,1218.66,4.56
it is great for quickly prototyping and,1221.299,4.201
showing something to your colleagues or,1223.22,5.24
your friends so now we have already,1225.5,7.74
built our first web page using flask,1228.46,6.7
and we can see it running and we can,1233.24,3.72
share it with others as well,1235.16,4.32
so we've done that now the last thing I,1236.96,4.02
want to show you is once you've done,1239.48,3.12
some work on replit and you want to save,1240.98,3.9
it back to GitHub how do you do that so,1242.6,4.319
right now if you see here if I reload,1244.88,4.38
this page GitHub still has the old,1246.919,4.62
version of the repository it does not,1249.26,3.659
have all the changes we've made on,1251.539,3.601
replit so just like we might do some,1252.919,4.5
development locally and then push our,1255.14,4.62
changes to GitHub in the same way we can,1257.419,4.561
come in here into the Version Control,1259.76,5.46
tab and on the Version Control tab we,1261.98,4.98
can review the changes that we've made,1265.22,3.66
so it looks like we've modified all of,1266.96,5.28
these files and then we can commit and,1268.88,6.0
we can push I can simply type what I've,1272.24,6.78
changed so added the flask project,1274.88,6.24
and I am going to click commit and push,1279.02,3.96
and that's going to save all of these,1281.12,3.299
changes it is going to create a git,1282.98,4.26
commit and it is going to then,1284.419,5.461
push these changes back to the main,1287.24,4.559
branch of the original repository,1289.88,5.88
akashina careers website so if I go back,1291.799,6.781
to github.com now and I reload the page,1295.76,5.34
you can see here now we have,1298.58,4.62
a bunch of other files but most,1301.1,5.1
importantly we have this app.pi file and,1303.2,5.94
this app.pi file now contains the route,1306.2,4.74
hello world,1309.14,4.32
so if you want to learn more about how,1310.94,4.32
GitHub works then you can check out this,1313.46,4.32
tutorial on GitHub and if you want to,1315.26,4.68
learn more about replit how it works and,1317.78,3.24
you can check out this tutorial and,1319.94,2.46
replied and similarly there is a,1321.02,3.12
tutorial on flask as well that you can,1322.4,4.019
check out we completed the first step,1324.14,4.62
which was to create a project on GitHub,1326.419,4.62
and then open up that project on,1328.76,5.46
replit.com then we created and ran a,1331.039,6.061
flask web server as you can see here,1334.22,5.699
and finally we push those changes back,1337.1,5.699
to GitHub so that we can share our,1339.919,6.201
project with others,1342.799,3.321
now we are going to start introducing,1346.28,5.639
some HTML and CSS,1349.1,4.86
so let's start with that,1351.919,3.901
now if we come back here to the files,1353.96,2.699
tab,1355.82,5.66
and create a folder called templates,1356.659,4.821
so you can see here I've used the plus,1362.36,3.6
add folder button and created a folder,1363.919,4.801
called templates and inside this folder,1365.96,4.74
I am going to add a file and I'm going,1368.72,4.5
to call this file home.html,1370.7,4.92
so this file is going to contain the,1373.22,6.06
information that I want to show on the,1375.62,4.86
page,1379.28,3.54
that is being rendered here,1380.48,4.199
right now we are simply showing the,1382.82,3.479
information hello jogan but we probably,1384.679,3.301
want to show something more than that we,1386.299,4.5
probably want to show a nice web page,1387.98,5.699
with some information some pictures some,1390.799,5.88
jobs so all of that we will be putting,1393.679,6.48
into this file home.html HTML is the,1396.679,5.701
language that is used to create web,1400.159,5.101
pages and you can check out any tutorial,1402.38,5.159
on HTML so the one that I would,1405.26,5.34
recommend is HTML dog.com it's really,1407.539,5.52
easy to get started and you can just go,1410.6,4.98
in HTML dog.com and open up the get,1413.059,4.681
started page and just create an HTML,1415.58,3.839
page and it contains a whole bunch of,1417.74,4.74
information on how to create HTML,1419.419,5.581
documents but this is the most basic,1422.48,5.28
structure of an HTML document you have,1425.0,4.44
something called a doctype declaration,1427.76,4.5
at the top so this tells the browser,1429.44,4.8
what kind of a,1432.26,5.52
document you are sending so if I type,1434.24,7.2
doctype HTML when we send this HTML to,1437.78,5.82
somebody's browser we're informing that,1441.44,4.44
we are writing HTML code,1443.6,4.86
and then you create what's called a tag,1445.88,5.4
so in HTML everything is constructed,1448.46,5.339
using tags any website you see on the,1451.28,4.5
internet is constructed using HTML tags,1453.799,5.521
so here the root tag or the outermost,1455.78,6.18
tag is called HTML and this is how you,1459.32,4.8
create a tag you have a less than,1461.96,4.079
and then you have the name of the tag,1464.12,3.6
and then you have a greater than so this,1466.039,4.081
is how you create the opening tag and,1467.72,4.68
then similar to the opening tag there is,1470.12,4.799
a closing tag and there is a slash at,1472.4,4.32
the beginning here after the less than,1474.919,3.181
symbol to indicate that this is the,1476.72,3.959
closing tag so basically what we're,1478.1,5.1
saying is that within the HTML tag we,1480.679,4.801
want to put some information so the root,1483.2,4.02
of your document the outermost tag in,1485.48,3.179
your document is always going to be the,1487.22,3.66
HTML tag,1488.659,5.4
now inside the HTML tag we generally put,1490.88,6.299
two tags we put head,1494.059,6.48
and we put body,1497.179,5.761
so body is what you want to actually,1500.539,4.62
show on the page,1502.94,4.7
and head is some other information,1505.159,5.101
typically this is what you want to show,1507.64,4.06
in the title bar you can put that,1510.26,3.18
information here if you want to include,1511.7,5.099
any styling declarations or css we,1513.44,4.92
generally put that in the head if you,1516.799,3.421
want to include any external Javascript,1518.36,4.08
libraries for interactivity we put that,1520.22,4.8
in the head so the head is just,1522.44,4.979
information that will be used to render,1525.02,4.56
some things on the body the body is the,1527.419,3.661
actual information that is going to get,1529.58,2.64
rendered,1531.08,4.44
so in the head typically one thing that,1532.22,5.04
is commonly put inside the head is the,1535.52,4.98
title and I'm going to call this Jovian,1537.26,5.88
couriers and let's just save that for,1540.5,6.059
now and inside the body is where you,1543.14,6.36
would put some information so here let,1546.559,4.98
me just write,1549.5,4.44
hello there,1551.539,4.981
you'll learn about,1553.94,5.839
the job openings,1556.52,3.259
at Jovian here,1560.72,5.579
so let me save that as well so we've,1563.72,5.22
created some HTML file inside a,1566.299,4.5
templates folder but how do we use it,1568.94,4.38
within the app to use a template we use,1570.799,4.681
the render template function,1573.32,4.44
from flask so from flask we import,1575.48,4.38
render template and instead of returning,1577.76,5.279
just a string hello world we say render,1579.86,4.38
template,1583.039,2.701
and then we give it the name of the,1584.24,3.12
template so in this case the template is,1585.74,3.419
called home.html so I'm just going to,1587.36,5.819
pass in home.html and there you go now,1589.159,6.481
inside home.html we are saying hello,1593.179,4.201
there you learn about the job openings,1595.64,3.72
at Jovian here and that's what shows up,1597.38,4.56
here and you can also open it up in a,1599.36,4.679
new tab and check the same thing hello,1601.94,3.719
there you'll learn about job openings at,1604.039,4.321
jobin here now not only that if you see,1605.659,4.081
carefully here,1608.36,3.419
you can see that now this says Jovian,1609.74,4.74
career so we have also set the title of,1611.779,4.441
this tab,1614.48,3.36
apart from the title we can actually,1616.22,4.38
also set this icon so just like you see,1617.84,4.62
all these different icons here we can,1620.6,3.42
actually also set these icons this is,1622.46,5.099
called the fave icon fav icon and I'll,1624.02,4.98
let you figure that out how to change,1627.559,4.921
the fav icon using a flask template so,1629.0,5.76
let's bring that back here now,1632.48,4.1
so great we are making progress already,1634.76,4.62
we are now starting to show some,1636.58,5.02
information about what we want to,1639.38,4.32
actually display on the site and we are,1641.6,3.9
doing this using a template,1643.7,4.62
now before we go further and try to just,1645.5,5.4
code the site directly it might be,1648.32,4.32
easier if we first figure out what,1650.9,4.019
exactly we want to show on the page and,1652.64,5.039
this is where you should put your laptop,1654.919,5.101
away and maybe start working using pen,1657.679,5.041
and paper and try to just draw out what,1660.02,4.56
you want to display on the page before,1662.72,3.66
you actually try to code it because if,1664.58,3.479
you don't have a clear picture of what,1666.38,3.539
you want to show then writing the code,1668.059,4.62
for it can get somewhat tricky so here,1669.919,4.38
I'm going to use a virtual whiteboard,1672.679,3.421
but please feel free to use pen and,1674.299,4.26
paper to do this and here I'm just going,1676.1,4.319
to draw a rectangle to represent the,1678.559,4.801
browser and now I am going to just put,1680.419,5.701
some information here inside which will,1683.36,5.1
give me a guide for what I want to,1686.12,4.799
actually show on the page so now let me,1688.46,7.02
go here and select the typing tool,1690.919,7.26
let's give this page a title Jovian,1695.48,4.62
careers and let's make that a little,1698.179,4.5
bigger we can also change the,1700.1,6.6
color here so let me make that dark,1702.679,6.24
so now here I'm going to have a title on,1706.7,4.68
the page called Jovian couriers then I,1708.919,4.801
am going to put an image on the page so,1711.38,4.02
here there's going to be just like a,1713.72,3.9
banner image and I don't know what I'm,1715.4,3.659
going to put in this Banner image but,1717.62,4.82
for now let me just draw some,1719.059,6.301
Hills and let me draw,1722.44,5.26
a tree,1725.36,4.02
the idea is I just want to tell myself,1727.7,3.06
that there's going to be an image here,1729.38,4.02
let me draw a river or something,1730.76,4.98
and then there is going to be maybe some,1733.4,4.019
information about shoving so I'm going,1735.74,3.6
to type about Jovian here and I'm going,1737.419,4.201
to make that a little bigger and I just,1739.34,3.6
want to have a few lines of information,1741.62,3.48
talking about jogan so I don't want to,1742.94,5.52
put any actual text here I'll just put,1745.1,6.12
lines to kind of roughly guide me that,1748.46,3.839
this is going to be just some,1751.22,2.22
information,1752.299,4.081
and then below this I am going to show,1753.44,3.9
some,1756.38,3.72
job openings so let's call this job,1757.34,4.62
openings,1760.1,4.14
and let's bring that a little bigger so,1761.96,4.319
maybe not this big but roughly about,1764.24,3.36
this big,1766.279,3.421
and this is called wireframing what,1767.6,3.959
you're doing here is you're creating a,1769.7,3.599
rough idea of what you want your site to,1771.559,4.021
look like and we don't want to get very,1773.299,4.38
detailed in terms of colors and fonts,1775.58,3.3
and all those things we just want to get,1777.679,3.72
a rough idea,1778.88,5.519
and then let us maybe list some job,1781.399,4.441
openings let's see what the job openings,1784.399,3.0
will look like so maybe data analyst is,1785.84,5.219
a job opening and maybe let me use a,1787.399,7.561
lighter color here just to emphasize,1791.059,5.521
that this is,1794.96,5.76
a part of this section and then under a,1796.58,5.76
job opening I may also want to maybe,1800.72,4.14
include where this job opening is based,1802.34,4.68
so let me call it Bengaluru,1804.86,3.539
India,1807.02,5.72
and let's make that a little smaller,1808.399,4.341
and maybe let's also put an apply button,1813.02,5.899
here next to the job opening,1815.36,3.559
so now we have an apply button that we,1820.159,2.88
want to show,1821.96,3.18
and maybe right below the absorb opening,1823.039,4.101
let's also show a line a quick separator,1825.14,4.98
and let me now take this,1827.14,5.68
and duplicate this a few times to get a,1830.12,5.659
list of job openings,1832.82,2.959
so now we have a second job opening,1841.039,3.781
again it's all approximately correct it,1842.96,4.38
doesn't have to be 100 aligned and now,1844.82,4.68
we have a third job opening and now we,1847.34,4.079
have a fourth job opening,1849.5,4.74
and that's it and maybe right below the,1851.419,6.301
last job opening let's put a button,1854.24,6.74
called contact us,1857.72,3.26
and that's actually not bad so let me,1861.559,6.561
just change that to data scientist,1864.08,4.04
let me change that to backend engineer,1868.82,5.42
let me change that to front end,1874.52,5.639
engineer and let me change this to,1877.94,5.7
remote let me change this to San,1880.159,5.101
Francisco,1883.64,3.06
USA,1885.26,4.2
let me change that to,1886.7,4.68
Delhi India,1889.46,4.199
we just spent four or five minutes,1891.38,3.96
designing,1893.659,5.041
this wireframe and all we've done here,1895.34,4.8
is we've figured out what we want to,1898.7,3.0
display on the page so we want to show,1900.14,3.3
jobin careers we want to show a picture,1901.7,3.719
we want to show about Jovian some,1903.44,3.359
information about Joven we want to show,1905.419,3.301
some job openings and for each job,1906.799,4.62
opening the title the location and then,1908.72,4.62
an apply button to apply for the job,1911.419,3.0
opening,1913.34,3.42
and a contact us button at the bottom in,1914.419,3.721
case somebody wants to directly contact,1916.76,3.72
us for whatever reason,1918.14,4.2
so this is always a good idea whenever,1920.48,3.48
you're doing any form of web development,1922.34,3.0
it's always great to start with the,1923.96,3.3
wireframe first and make it as quick and,1925.34,4.02
dirty as possible so what I've done here,1927.26,3.779
is I've actually created three,1929.36,3.6
wireframes so this is the one page that,1931.039,4.74
we have about Jovian open positions and,1932.96,4.68
contact us,1935.779,5.461
and along with this I've also created a,1937.64,4.98
couple more wireframes if you click the,1941.24,3.539
apply button then we will go to a job,1942.62,4.799
Details page here we have the data,1944.779,4.02
analyst job where we have the,1947.419,3.061
responsibilities and the requirements of,1948.799,3.661
the job and the salary information for,1950.48,3.96
the job and below it we are going to,1952.46,4.26
have an application form and in this,1954.44,3.839
application form these are the fields,1956.72,3.12
we're going to have and this is what is,1958.279,3.421
going to get submitted and after,1959.84,3.6
submitting we are going to show this,1961.7,3.54
page which says your application has,1963.44,3.18
been submitted and you reach out with,1965.24,3.059
the next steps now this is what you,1966.62,3.419
should create to just brainstorm with,1968.299,3.421
your team or just figure out if this is,1970.039,3.301
what you want to work on if there are,1971.72,3.42
any major changes required if we have,1973.34,3.719
all the information or not,1975.14,4.019
and then you can maybe try to either,1977.059,3.901
convert it into a more detailed design,1979.159,4.201
or you can start coding directly either,1980.96,4.439
is fine but this is the information that,1983.36,4.98
we want to get onto the page and we've,1985.399,4.981
done that by creating a quick wireframe,1988.34,5.28
so now keeping this wireframe next to us,1990.38,5.94
let's start creating the page,1993.62,4.32
so the first thing we want to show here,1996.32,4.56
is Joven careers,1997.94,5.7
and we want to make this big we want to,2000.88,4.44
make this really big how do we make it,2003.64,4.259
big well that's what HTML headers are,2005.32,5.88
for now if we go back on HTML tutorial,2007.899,5.541
here,2011.2,2.24
you can see here that there are six,2014.019,4.741
levels of headings available on HTML so,2016.539,3.721
I'm just going to click on headings this,2018.76,3.32
is part of the HTML beginner tutorial,2020.26,4.799
and under headings you can see that this,2022.08,5.199
is how you create a heading,2025.059,4.381
you create a tag called H1 and then you,2027.279,3.661
put some information inside it and then,2029.44,3.66
you close the tag with a closing tag and,2030.94,4.44
then you have H2 and you have H3 and so,2033.1,4.62
on so let me just go back here and let,2035.38,6.139
me just put an H1 here,2037.72,3.799
and now as soon as I change this to H1,2044.38,4.92
you can see that this becomes big,2047.2,5.34
next we wanted to have an image let me,2049.3,4.98
try and add an image here so how do we,2052.54,4.02
add an image again we go back here we,2054.28,4.44
check HTML tutorials how do we add,2056.56,3.18
images,2058.72,3.54
I'm going to click on image and it looks,2059.74,4.32
like this is how you add an image so an,2062.26,4.26
image is a self-closing tag because,2064.06,4.14
there's nothing that you put inside the,2066.52,4.139
image tag you just give it a source so,2068.2,3.719
here now we are seeing for the first,2070.659,3.841
time something called an attribute apart,2071.919,5.76
from a tag and something inside the tag,2074.5,5.04
so for example here we have something,2077.679,4.621
inside the H1 tag Joven careers,2079.54,4.859
here we don't have anything inside the,2082.3,4.379
tag but we have this SRC information,2084.399,6.301
here so let me just take that IMG SRC,2086.679,6.321
actually let me just do that here IMG,2090.7,5.219
SRC equals some information,2093.0,5.74
and close that and SRC is going to,2095.919,7.2
accept a URL so let me copy this URL and,2098.74,6.359
let me comment paste that URL in here,2103.119,5.181
and let's run that,2105.099,3.201
and you can see that this is not loading,2108.52,3.24
up maybe there's some issue maybe this,2110.2,3.84
image does not exist but in any case we,2111.76,3.839
don't want to show this URL we want to,2114.04,3.42
show some nice picture about career,2115.599,3.781
growth about work and things like that,2117.46,5.159
so one good place to find good images,2119.38,7.1
for your websites is unsplash.com that's,2122.619,7.201
unsplash on splash.com,2126.48,6.7
and on onsplash.com you can find royalty,2129.82,4.92
free images which means that you don't,2133.18,4.2
need to buy these photos to use them you,2134.74,4.5
can use them commercially and I'm just,2137.38,4.38
going to search for career,2139.24,5.04
and,2141.76,4.74
this one looks nice this one looks,2144.28,3.66
interesting so I'm just going to,2146.5,3.78
download this picture here,2147.94,5.82
and I'm gonna put this in here,2150.28,5.94
and let's also rename this let's call,2153.76,5.16
this banner.jpeg,2156.22,6.18
and jpeg is simply the file format and,2158.92,6.6
now we want to show this file banner.jpg,2162.4,4.62
here,2165.52,4.26
so where exactly is this file right now,2167.02,4.74
this file is on our computer and our,2169.78,3.48
computer is not accessible on the,2171.76,3.06
internet so we need to take this file,2173.26,3.66
and put it somewhere where it can be,2174.82,5.1
accessed by our flask application and,2176.92,5.159
that's where there is this folder called,2179.92,3.48
Static,2182.079,3.0
so this should be outside templates not,2183.4,3.06
inside,2185.079,3.54
let me just move it out so I've created,2186.46,3.96
this folder called Static and anything,2188.619,3.661
that you put under the static folder,2190.42,4.88
will be directly shared by flask,2192.28,6.299
externally so if I just upload a file,2195.3,5.74
here so I can click upload file,2198.579,5.881
and I can select banner.jpeg and then,2201.04,5.34
you can see banner.jpg got added here,2204.46,3.659
but I want to move it inside static so,2206.38,3.9
I'm going to move it inside static,2208.119,5.101
and now flask will allow you to access,2210.28,4.44
this file,2213.22,3.359
using the URL,2214.72,3.66
let me open this in a new tab so this is,2216.579,4.081
the URL of the server this is where we,2218.38,4.5
are rendering the route slash but if you,2220.66,5.699
type slash static s t a t i c and then,2222.88,4.8
you type the name of the file,2226.359,4.26
banner.jpeg,2227.68,5.04
you will see that we have this file here,2230.619,5.161
right here so what I've done here is,2232.72,4.139
simply,2235.78,3.44
Jovian couriers,2236.859,3.841
website.akashness.revel.com so this was,2239.22,3.52
the main website that was getting,2240.7,4.08
rendered I've just put slash static,2242.74,4.32
slash banner.jpg and anything that was,2244.78,4.38
inside the static folder will show up,2247.06,4.44
here with the corresponding URL,2249.16,4.98
so now I can take this URL,2251.5,4.859
and let me go back here,2254.14,6.9
and now I can put this here under SRC,2256.359,7.441
okay and now you can see that as soon as,2261.04,5.039
I put this in now this image file is,2263.8,3.48
showing up here,2266.079,2.941
now of course this image file is a bit,2267.28,3.72
too large so on the image tag you can,2269.02,4.02
also specify width and height so I'm,2271.0,3.54
just going to specify,2273.04,3.9
a height,2274.54,4.079
now the height is measured in pixels,2276.94,3.6
pixels are simply dots on the screen I'm,2278.619,4.561
going to just roughly put it at 320,2280.54,4.86
pixels or I'm just going to put 320 and,2283.18,3.54
that's going to automatically convert,2285.4,2.699
that into pixels,2286.72,3.96
and now you can see here this image has,2288.099,4.201
been loaded,2290.68,4.2
so now we have an image and now under,2292.3,4.98
this image we want this information,2294.88,4.86
about Joven so let's get that in as well,2297.28,5.04
so now we want a smaller heading so,2299.74,5.52
let's call that about Jovian,2302.32,6.06
and now let's add a paragraph of text,2305.26,6.12
below it so here now we want some text,2308.38,5.58
below it now whenever you are just,2311.38,4.14
building out a site you don't want to,2313.96,3.84
have to type a lot of text and that's,2315.52,4.14
where there are text generators,2317.8,4.08
available online so just search for text,2319.66,4.14
generator,2321.88,3.719
one thing that might help is to just,2323.8,3.96
search for lorem ipsum text generator so,2325.599,4.141
lorem ipsum is just a standard text that,2327.76,5.04
is used often for a lot of websites so,2329.74,4.98
here yeah you can just click how many,2332.8,3.24
paragraphs you want and you can click,2334.72,3.0
generate and it's going to generate some,2336.04,4.38
text for you so lorem ipsum.io is the,2337.72,4.68
site that you want to go to,2340.42,4.8
and here you can just copy all of this,2342.4,4.62
code so this is just some text you can,2345.22,3.359
use any text but I'm just using a text,2347.02,3.599
generator which can generate any amount,2348.579,4.321
of text I want and now I'm going to put,2350.619,5.281
it in a P tag P stands for paragraph so,2352.9,4.56
whenever you want to put some paragraph,2355.9,4.199
of text you use the P tag and inside the,2357.46,6.119
P tag I have put in lorem ipsum and now,2360.099,5.221
we have jobin careers we have an image,2363.579,4.681
we have about Joven so it's shaping up,2365.32,5.82
well and now below about Jovian we want,2368.26,6.24
to have another section and now this,2371.14,4.74
should be called,2374.5,4.02
I believe job openings,2375.88,5.1
or open positions so let's use this one,2378.52,4.74
open position so let's just call this,2380.98,3.78
open,2383.26,3.66
positions,2384.76,4.859
and then here we are going to again show,2386.92,4.74
the jobs here so let's mark this as a,2389.619,3.301
to-do that's something that we'll,2391.66,3.66
Implement later and then finally at the,2392.92,4.32
very end of this we will have a button,2395.32,4.68
called contact us so again I'm using the,2397.24,5.46
button tag here so how do you know which,2400.0,5.16
tag is the appropriate one to use that's,2402.7,3.899
where you should probably work through,2405.16,3.959
an HTML tutorial so here on the HTML,2406.599,4.321
tutorial you can see what are all the,2409.119,3.321
different kind of things you can create,2410.92,4.5
using HTML and what the different tags,2412.44,4.0
are,2415.42,3.439
so go to HTML dog.com or go to,2416.44,5.1
w3schools.com but you've already learned,2418.859,5.621
some of the most common tags H1 IMG H1,2421.54,5.819
is header H2S header IMG is image p is,2424.48,5.76
paragraph button is just button so now,2427.359,4.921
we have Joven careers and then we have,2430.24,4.26
about Jovian and then we have open,2432.28,5.1
positions and then we have contact us so,2434.5,4.619
the structure of the site is there but,2437.38,4.08
of course it looks ugly it doesn't,2439.119,5.581
really look that great so so far we have,2441.46,5.399
seen how to render templates and use,2444.7,4.68
static assets so anything that you put,2446.859,3.841
inside a static folder is typically,2449.38,4.56
called an asset images Etc called assets,2450.7,5.1
then we have seen how to create the,2453.94,4.62
layout of the page using HTML tags and,2455.8,4.5
now we are going to start styling the,2458.56,4.98
page using something called CSS HTML,2460.3,5.58
stands for hypertext markup language it,2463.54,3.66
is simply the language used to create,2465.88,4.02
web pages and CSS stands for cascading,2467.2,4.86
style sheets it is used to provide some,2469.9,5.64
style to our HTML pages so let's start,2472.06,5.58
adding some CSS now,2475.54,4.68
how do you figure out what to do with,2477.64,5.1
CSS the best way is to do a quick CSS,2480.22,4.56
tutorial and you can work through the,2482.74,3.54
beginner tutorial it should take maybe,2484.78,4.079
an hour maybe a couple of hours but the,2486.28,5.04
way CSS works is using something called,2488.859,5.581
selectors so what we do is create,2491.32,6.6
something called a style tag in our head,2494.44,5.34
so in the head of the document we create,2497.92,5.52
a style tag and in the style tag we need,2499.78,7.68
to tell the browser how to apply a,2503.44,5.88
certain color or a certain font or a,2507.46,4.379
certain layout to a specific portion of,2509.32,4.98
the HTML page one way to do it is by,2511.839,4.681
simply specifying a tag you can say H1,2514.3,5.4
and now you can open curly brackets or,2516.52,5.64
braces so now we are telling the browser,2519.7,4.8
anytime you see an H1 which means you,2522.16,4.14
see this is an H1 it is highlighted here,2524.5,4.68
so anytime you see an H1 apply these,2526.3,4.86
styles to the H1 now we have made a,2529.18,4.919
selection using a tag and now we are,2531.16,4.8
going to apply some styles,2534.099,5.041
every style you apply has two parts one,2535.96,5.7
is what property you want to change so,2539.14,4.68
if I come back here one thing I might,2541.66,4.38
want to change is the font size this is,2543.82,4.32
probably not big enough so I can say,2546.04,4.98
font size so this is the property,2548.14,5.82
and then what value do you want to set,2551.02,4.559
this property to so you type the,2553.96,3.72
property which is typically a hyphenated,2555.579,4.141
word and you can look up the full list,2557.68,4.679
of properties here so you can go back,2559.72,5.1
into the HTML tutorial you can see what,2562.359,5.22
all properties are available to apply to,2564.82,3.96
fonts so you can say something called,2567.579,3.361
font family which is like which font to,2568.78,4.92
use font size which is how to set the,2570.94,4.44
size font weight you can make bold,2573.7,5.28
italics Etc font style Etc so which,2575.38,6.36
property you want to change font size,2578.98,4.68
and what do we want to change the font,2581.74,4.56
size to let me try 80 pixels any,2583.66,4.439
property that is the size of some form,2586.3,3.72
is specified using pixels which is how,2588.099,3.541
many dots on the screen it should take,2590.02,3.54
up so let me change that to 80 pixels,2591.64,4.56
and let's save that,2593.56,4.2
and now you can see that this has become,2596.2,4.139
way too big so maybe not 80 maybe I want,2597.76,5.78
to stick with 40 pixels,2600.339,3.201
then let's try to change the font family,2603.7,4.68
so the font family is simply which font,2605.92,5.22
you want to use so let me try a font,2608.38,5.28
called Roboto okay and you can look up,2611.14,5.4
interesting fonts online but I am going,2613.66,5.82
to try Roboto and let me change that I,2616.54,4.38
think this looks nicer this looks more,2619.48,3.96
modern so that's nice then I can change,2620.92,4.98
the font weight so right now I believe,2623.44,4.26
it is set to bold but if I change this,2625.9,4.32
to normal it'll become thinner,2627.7,4.159
you can see that it has become thinner,2630.22,3.96
in this way you can make a bunch of,2631.859,4.0
changes and this is going to apply to,2634.18,4.139
all H1 tags now in our page we only have,2635.859,4.681
one H1 tag but let's say if we had,2638.319,4.201
another H1 tag here,2640.54,4.62
maybe below the image,2642.52,4.819
foreign,2645.16,2.179
careers too it's going to apply there as,2647.579,3.341
well,2650.079,3.181
so these are some text related things,2650.92,3.78
then let's say I want to change the,2653.26,3.18
color so I can change the color as well,2654.7,3.48
so you type color and then here you have,2656.44,4.919
to specify a color using the RGB scale,2658.18,5.639
or the red green blue scale every color,2661.359,4.74
that you see on a screen is built using,2663.819,4.921
red green and blue colors so you can,2666.099,6.361
type RGB and then you can specify the,2668.74,5.46
amount of red the amount of green and,2672.46,4.68
the amount of blue to use so if I put 0,2674.2,5.04
0 0,2677.14,5.699
then here we are simply using black but,2679.24,6.72
if I change this to maybe 100,2682.839,4.74
now you can see that it starts to get,2685.96,5.22
redder now the values go from 0 to 255,2687.579,6.601
so 255 is the highest zero is the lowest,2691.18,5.82
so now it's complete red the R value is,2694.18,7.2
255 then let me try green so 255,2697.0,6.78
and now we have red and green and now it,2701.38,3.78
has become yellow because red and green,2703.78,3.0
together become yellow let me change,2705.16,3.72
that to 0 and now this is completely,2706.78,3.66
green you can see all these examples so,2708.88,3.239
if you have equal values for red green,2710.44,3.179
and blue then it's a shade of gray,2712.119,3.661
otherwise it is more mixed of a certain,2713.619,5.761
color than others a 0 is darker 255 is,2715.78,6.12
the brightest so I'm just going to pick,2719.38,4.14
a medium gray so I'm going to pick,2721.9,3.56
something like 180,2723.52,6.18
180 and 180.,2725.46,6.52
that looks nice to go darker you have to,2729.7,4.02
go lower so let me make that hundred,2731.98,4.46
hundred hundred,2733.72,2.72
all right so now we have a nice gray,2737.02,4.92
title and we also want to Center the,2739.06,5.34
title so in the wireframe we drew we had,2741.94,4.5
the title in the center but here the,2744.4,4.199
title is somewhere in the corner so,2746.44,3.84
let's Center that and the simple way to,2748.599,4.441
center that is to use text align,2750.28,5.1
center now do you need to remember all,2753.04,5.22
this no you can always just go how to,2755.38,7.08
center align text in CSS,2758.26,6.96
and find the result directly text align,2762.46,4.26
Center and that is going to Center the,2765.22,3.78
text view so now our text is centered,2766.72,6.899
that's nice then we have this image here,2769.0,7.02
I want this image to run across the,2773.619,5.341
entire page so let me set it up in such,2776.02,4.319
a way that it runs across the entire,2778.96,3.48
page so I'm going to go to this image,2780.339,5.401
and this time I don't want every image,2782.44,5.22
to run across the entire page I just,2785.74,4.02
want this one particular image to run,2787.66,4.56
across the entire page to be completely,2789.76,5.28
white so I'm going to give it an ID,2792.22,4.5
okay so now we're looking at the second,2795.04,4.319
way to select something on the page and,2796.72,4.92
apply a style to it and I'm going to,2799.359,3.72
then type,2801.64,3.36
hash Banner so whenever you have given,2803.079,3.601
something an ID and you want to access,2805.0,3.24
it in CSS,2806.68,3.48
so you type the hash character or the,2808.24,3.78
pound character and then type the ID,2810.16,4.32
that you've given it and now this will,2812.02,4.62
only apply to the tag which has the ID,2814.48,4.859
Banner so ID is ideally something that,2816.64,4.56
should be unique on the page only one,2819.339,3.541
element on the page should have an ID,2821.2,3.96
otherwise your browser may get confused,2822.88,5.1
so now we select hash banner and that is,2825.16,4.38
going to select the image banner and for,2827.98,2.82
a moment I'm going to get rid of this,2829.54,2.819
height because I'm going to set it using,2830.8,2.64
CSS,2832.359,3.72
and now I am going to first set its,2833.44,4.919
width to 100 percent,2836.079,5.181
let's see that,2838.359,2.901
okay so the width is 100 but that's,2841.42,6.96
probably too big now so now I'm going to,2844.78,5.9
limit the height let me set the height,2848.38,8.939
to 360 pixels or 360 dots and I'm just,2850.68,8.8
following the same format here property,2857.319,5.76
colon and some number and anytime you,2859.48,5.099
have a doubt about this you just have to,2863.079,4.02
look up some reference and figure it out,2864.579,4.561
even after 15 plus years of web,2867.099,3.841
development I look these things up all,2869.14,2.64
the time,2870.94,3.659
so now we have height set to 360 pixels,2871.78,4.02
let's,2874.599,4.02
reload that so this is looking good but,2875.8,4.08
you can see that the picture is,2878.619,3.301
stretched a little bit and if this was,2879.88,4.26
some photograph then it would look,2881.92,5.82
really bad so then you can unstretch the,2884.14,5.219
picture so there are ways to unstretch,2887.74,3.18
the picture I'm just using something,2889.359,3.361
that I looked up earlier called object,2890.92,4.439
fit which is used to make sure that,2892.72,4.2
instead of stretching the picture we,2895.359,3.48
simply use the portion of the picture,2896.92,4.74
that can fit inside the content so now,2898.839,4.681
this was the original picture do,2901.66,3.84
something great you can see here that it,2903.52,4.02
was actually quite tall and now the same,2905.5,4.14
thing is showing up here,2907.54,4.38
so now this picture runs across the,2909.64,4.56
screen so that's nice now let's go in,2911.92,4.38
here and let's change the H2 as well so,2914.2,3.899
for the H2S,2916.3,4.26
I'm going to use the font Roboto again,2918.099,4.561
so font family,2920.56,4.2
Roboto,2922.66,4.5
then I'm going to use the font size,2924.76,5.7
Let's see we used 40 for H1 so let me,2927.16,6.84
use 32 for H2,2930.46,7.619
and then I am going to use the color,2934.0,5.88
maybe let's make this a little darker,2938.079,4.801
let's make this 50,2939.88,8.0
50 and 50 and let's make this,2942.88,5.0
hundred hundred and hundred,2949.119,7.441
and finally I am also going to text,2952.839,6.141
align,2956.56,2.42
Center,2959.74,4.02
so my H2S you will see that there are,2961.18,4.32
two H2S on the page both of them are,2963.76,4.319
fixed and now I maybe also want to use,2965.5,5.22
Font weight normal even,2968.079,5.04
and that's nice now finally we have this,2970.72,4.02
paragraph tag so let me take this,2973.119,4.801
paragraph and let me style that as well,2974.74,5.04
again I'm just going to use Font family,2977.92,4.199
Roboto for now all over my page I like,2979.78,5.4
the Roboto font and I'm going to change,2982.119,7.74
the color to RGB 8080,2985.18,4.679
so now we have jobin careers do,2993.7,3.06
something great about Jovian open,2995.319,2.641
positions,2996.76,3.3
it's looking better looking better but,2997.96,3.6
of course not looking very professional,3000.06,3.42
I think one of the things here is that,3001.56,3.539
this text is becoming really hard to,3003.48,3.119
read because it is going from the left,3005.099,3.781
to right so what we may want to put is,3006.599,4.321
we may want to just limit the amount of,3008.88,4.26
content to somewhere in the center for,3010.92,4.14
example if you go to,3013.14,4.92
zero to pandas.com one of our courses,3015.06,5.34
you will see here that this is slightly,3018.06,4.259
more readable because the content is,3020.4,4.62
centered it is not expanding to take up,3022.319,4.921
the entire space now how do we do that,3025.02,5.46
the way to apply such layout related,3027.24,7.92
changes is using special tags called div,3030.48,7.2
so I'm going to take all of this and put,3035.16,4.38
this in a div tag,3037.68,4.679
I am going to put this in a div tag and,3039.54,5.579
I am going to then,3042.359,4.441
give that a little tap so that it's,3045.119,3.061
easier to see,3046.8,4.319
and now for this div tag I can give it,3048.18,5.58
an ID so let me give it an ID container,3051.119,4.5
and then let me select the container,3053.76,4.819
hash container,3055.619,2.96
and now I want to limit the width of,3058.98,3.96
this container and the way to limit,3061.619,2.761
width is using something called Max,3062.94,3.899
width again all you need to do is look,3064.38,5.4
up how to limit the width of a div and,3066.839,5.641
let me give it 720 pixels as the max,3069.78,4.62
width,3072.48,3.839
and let's see,3074.4,4.02
so now it is limited taking up less,3076.319,5.52
space on the screen but I do not want it,3078.42,5.76
to be on the left I want it to be,3081.839,4.681
centered now the way centering is,3084.18,5.7
achieved in CSS is by providing margins,3086.52,5.64
and this is where we may want to learn,3089.88,4.26
about something called the CSS Box model,3092.16,6.56
so if you just look for CSS Box model,3094.14,4.58
and look for an image,3098.819,6.661
this is basically how a div or any,3101.88,5.939
element in HTML is displayed on a page,3105.48,5.28
you have the content and then around the,3107.819,4.74
content you can specify something called,3110.76,4.5
padding some space and then outside the,3112.559,4.441
padding you can specify the border and,3115.26,3.299
then outside the Border you can specify,3117.0,4.14
more space called margin now don't worry,3118.559,4.921
if these terms don't make sense yet but,3121.14,4.439
the basic idea is anything inside the,3123.48,4.56
border is the content and outside the,3125.579,5.401
border is the margin so all of these are,3128.04,4.799
just different ways of providing space,3130.98,5.16
so let's talk about margins and let us,3132.839,5.881
try margin left,3136.14,5.88
and let us give it a margin of 80 pixels,3138.72,5.76
let's see what happens,3142.02,4.319
so if we give it a margin of 80 pixels,3144.48,3.839
and I reload the page you can see that,3146.339,4.5
now there is 80 pixels of space on the,3148.319,3.54
left,3150.839,5.161
still not centered maybe let me try,3151.859,8.46
200 pixels maybe that will Center it,3156.0,6.359
okay looks like it's getting to the,3160.319,4.561
center but not quite so I may experiment,3162.359,4.621
and I may shift it left and right and,3164.88,4.62
find the center but what if the screen,3166.98,4.619
size changes now suddenly it's off to,3169.5,4.2
the left so this is where,3171.599,5.161
we can use a trick instead of specifying,3173.7,5.1
margin left we can specify just margin,3176.76,4.74
and margin takes four arguments so,3178.8,5.279
margin can take four values where for,3181.5,4.26
the box that you want to apply this,3184.079,4.321
margin to you can specify how much,3185.76,4.26
margin you want on the top how much,3188.4,2.88
space you want on the right how much,3190.02,2.76
space you want on the bottom and on the,3191.28,4.44
left so in my case I don't need any,3192.78,4.62
space on the top so I'm just going to,3195.72,3.06
put 0 here,3197.4,4.02
maybe I want 80 pixels on the left and,3198.78,4.079
then I don't want any space on the,3201.42,3.24
bottom and then maybe I want 80 pixels,3202.859,2.881
on the right,3204.66,3.659
but ET on the left 80 on the right that,3205.74,4.8
may not do the job how exactly do you,3208.319,5.161
decide what 80 pixels is once it picks,3210.54,5.16
80 pixels on the left there's so much,3213.48,4.44
gap on the right that 80 is not going to,3215.7,4.32
do it so here's something that you can,3217.92,4.199
do in CSS something that you will do,3220.02,5.339
very often is make the left and right,3222.119,5.341
margin Auto,3225.359,4.921
then the browser decides that it has to,3227.46,4.68
give an automatic margin on both left,3230.28,3.839
and right and suddenly it gives you an,3232.14,3.66
equal margin,3234.119,4.021
so whenever you want to Center something,3235.8,5.22
on the page just use margin 0 Auto 0,3238.14,3.84
Auto,3241.02,3.9
or you can also just say zero or two and,3241.98,4.8
it will take this value and apply to the,3244.92,3.54
top and bottom and it will take this,3246.78,3.9
value and apply to the left and right so,3248.46,4.98
margin 0 Auto is a quick way to Center,3250.68,5.1
something on a page,3253.44,5.879
so this is definitely looking better,3255.78,5.94
there is a contact us here at the bottom,3259.319,4.74
let's Center that as well so here's what,3261.72,4.68
I'm going to do I am going to just put,3264.059,4.861
another div around this,3266.4,4.26
and,3268.92,3.3
what you need to do is you actually need,3270.66,3.36
to apply text line Center on this,3272.22,3.119
container and that is going to Center,3274.02,4.14
the button here now just for this,3275.339,5.041
creating an entire style declaration may,3278.16,4.74
become too much work so what I'm going,3280.38,4.02
to do is I'm going to apply the style,3282.9,3.36
inline so this is another way of,3284.4,4.8
applying CSS where you can apply Styles,3286.26,4.92
inline on a page so I'm just going to,3289.2,4.44
set style equals and I'm going to set,3291.18,4.62
text align,3293.64,4.439
Center and whenever you have just one or,3295.8,4.2
two small properties to put you can,3298.079,3.661
always just do that and now that has,3300.0,3.599
centered the button on the page one way,3301.74,4.92
of applying CSS is in the style tag in,3303.599,5.161
the head and then in the style tag you,3306.66,3.659
can select by,3308.76,5.16
tag you can select by ID,3310.319,6.661
and one other way of applying CSS is by,3313.92,5.399
directly specifying a style and then the,3316.98,5.28
property colon the value within the tag,3319.319,5.161
itself as an attribute using the style,3322.26,3.54
attribute,3324.48,3.96
now I want to show you one last way of,3325.8,6.18
specifying Styles which is not using,3328.44,5.76
tags and not using IDs which is using,3331.98,4.44
something called class now here we have,3334.2,4.5
a bunch of paragraphs right we have this,3336.42,3.659
paragraph here and then we have this,3338.7,2.639
paragraph here and because we have,3340.079,3.601
styled the P tag both of these,3341.339,5.401
paragraphs got affected by the P tag but,3343.68,4.62
let's say we also had another paragraph,3346.74,3.839
somewhere here at the bottom,3348.3,4.019
saying,3350.579,3.841
copyright,3352.319,4.26
2022,3354.42,3.6
Jovian,3356.579,3.661
and we did not want to apply the same,3358.02,4.14
style to this bottom tag as well maybe,3360.24,4.44
we want the copyright 2022 Joven to be,3362.16,4.38
small not big like this and maybe we,3364.68,3.48
also don't want it to be in the Roboto,3366.54,4.5
font so how do we do that this p is,3368.16,5.34
going to apply to all the paragraph tags,3371.04,5.039
so here is what we can do we can go into,3373.5,5.579
the paragraph tag and we can say class,3376.079,5.76
and we can now give it a name,3379.079,6.601
let's call this class body text you can,3381.839,5.401
call it anything you want the class name,3385.68,3.0
doesn't matter,3387.24,4.2
and let's call this also body text and,3388.68,5.22
let's not give this class to this third,3391.44,5.52
P tag okay and now instead of styling,3393.9,6.3
the P tag let us style the body text,3396.96,5.879
class so now we want to say dot body,3400.2,5.639
text and what this will do is any,3402.839,5.461
element whether it's a p a div whatever,3405.839,5.24
any element that has the class body text,3408.3,6.0
specified like this class body text is,3411.079,5.5
going to get these Styles and any,3414.3,3.48
element that does not have the class,3416.579,2.701
body text is not going to get these,3417.78,3.66
Styles so now if you see here this got,3419.28,5.1
applied body text this got body text,3421.44,5.159
but this did not get the styles that we,3424.38,3.66
applied using the class,3426.599,4.26
so that is the third way to apply CSS,3428.04,5.46
Styles okay so now we have one way which,3430.859,4.621
is to specify a tag name and then,3433.5,4.619
specify properties and values then we,3435.48,4.2
have another way which is to use an ID,3438.119,3.421
and then we have Third Way which is to,3439.68,3.78
use it class and the ID is specified,3441.54,4.5
using hash the class is specified using,3443.46,5.28
dot now remember ID ideally there should,3446.04,4.559
only be one element with a particular ID,3448.74,4.26
on the page because that's what browsers,3450.599,4.74
expect ID is identifier it is unique,3453.0,4.319
class can be applied to many elements,3455.339,3.48
that's the difference between ID and,3457.319,2.601
class,3458.819,4.621
and another way to apply CSS is directly,3459.92,6.399
using the style tag so with that now we,3463.44,4.919
have done some basic styling so that's,3466.319,4.621
fine we have now styled the page using,3468.359,6.24
CSS classes properties and values,3470.94,5.58
now one thing I want to show you is how,3474.599,4.26
to use a framework for faster,3476.52,4.14
development instead of having to type,3478.859,4.561
all the CSS manually for every website,3480.66,5.58
that you build you can use pre-existing,3483.42,5.04
set of styles that have been created by,3486.24,4.2
some good designers because you may not,3488.46,3.599
have great design skills I certainly,3490.44,3.179
don't as you can see,3492.059,4.861
so you can use pre-designed Styles and,3493.619,5.341
you can simply apply those styles to,3496.92,4.679
your page by specifying classes so,3498.96,4.2
here's what I mean let me first save,3501.599,2.401
this,3503.16,3.36
so let me say added,3504.0,6.38
HTML and CSS,3506.52,3.86
okay and let me come back here and let,3510.54,5.36
me get rid of all these styles,3512.339,3.561
okay and I'm also going to remove this,3517.38,5.54
one piece of style that I have here,3519.24,3.68
and I'm going to,3524.04,5.64
maybe also remove this body text for now,3526.26,5.16
I'm just gonna make it,3529.68,5.46
really basic just the HTML let's get rid,3531.42,6.24
of this as well,3535.14,6.479
and now let me go online and search for,3537.66,7.08
this Library called bootstrap,3541.619,6.5
bootstrap CSS,3544.74,3.379
so get bootstrap.com is the website,3548.579,6.24
and on getbootstrap.com you will find,3551.579,6.961
this Library the CSS framework which can,3554.819,6.601
be used to apply Styles easily to any,3558.54,4.68
website that you're building so let's,3561.42,4.56
click read the docs and let's see how to,3563.22,3.899
get started,3565.98,3.06
so first it says that you need to create,3567.119,4.021
a project you need to have an HTML file,3569.04,4.079
I think we have an HTML file already we,3571.14,3.659
have the file home.html that we are,3573.119,4.021
already working with and,3574.799,4.32
here it says that you need to add these,3577.14,3.9
couple of extra tags this is just some,3579.119,4.68
information so that bootstrap works,3581.04,4.559
properly we're not using bootstrap yet,3583.799,4.381
so let me copy these two meta tags and,3585.599,4.321
pop these into the head,3588.18,3.72
all right nothing has changed no change,3589.92,5.1
so far as such,3591.9,6.36
then it says include bootstrap CSS and,3595.02,6.539
JS so here it says that we want to copy,3598.26,7.28
this link tag here,3601.559,3.981
and put it in the head,3606.839,4.02
so for now I'm not going to include the,3609.0,3.78
JS or the JavaScript because we're not,3610.859,3.96
doing any interactive work right now but,3612.78,5.16
I'm going to copy the CSS so here,3614.819,5.461
all we need to do is come and paste this,3617.94,3.659
link tag,3620.28,5.22
and this link tag is simply a way to add,3621.599,6.301
a link to some other resource on the,3625.5,5.099
internet inside your HTML page and what,3627.9,4.26
are we linking to we are linking to the,3630.599,3.361
CSS file and you can actually open up,3632.16,3.6
the CSS file and see what it contains,3633.96,3.78
you can see that it contains a whole,3635.76,4.799
bunch of pre-configured styles for us so,3637.74,4.2
if I zoom in here you can see it,3640.559,4.981
contains like box Shadow Focus font,3641.94,6.119
weight etc etc so we don't need to worry,3645.54,4.559
about what it contains but it contains a,3648.059,4.8
set of pre-existing Styles and as soon,3650.099,5.941
as we add this link tag and Save,3652.859,5.161
all these pre-existing Styles get,3656.04,4.92
applied to our page immediately so if I,3658.02,5.52
reload here you can see that I already,3660.96,4.5
automatically got some really nice,3663.54,3.0
styles,3665.46,3.599
now they still need some work but this,3666.54,3.96
is looking pretty good,3669.059,4.56
and now if you go here and check the,3670.5,5.46
left side you're going to find a lot of,3673.619,4.98
utility classes the folks who built,3675.96,4.98
bootstrap have already implemented a lot,3678.599,5.281
of styles a lot of CSS and to apply,3680.94,5.52
those Styles all we need to do is add,3683.88,6.06
the appropriate classes into our HTML so,3686.46,4.8
here's what I mean let me show you an,3689.94,3.96
example let me go into containers and it,3691.26,4.079
says containers are a fundamental,3693.9,3.36
building block of bootstrap they contain,3695.339,4.081
and align your content within a given,3697.26,4.5
device or viewport okay all that is nice,3699.42,4.919
and here it says that there is a class,3701.76,5.039
container so dot always means class,3704.339,4.141
right so there is a class container,3706.799,4.621
which sets a maximum width with proper,3708.48,4.74
break points so let's not worry about,3711.42,3.84
all that let's just do this let us copy,3713.22,4.32
this class name container and let us,3715.26,4.5
come to the outermost div here and let,3717.54,4.62
us type class equals,3719.76,4.62
container okay all I'm doing here is,3722.16,4.62
just giving my outer div a class called,3724.38,5.76
container and what has that done that is,3726.78,5.16
now ensured,3730.14,3.78
if I reload the page here,3731.94,3.54
you're going to see that that is now,3733.92,3.419
centered my content on the page okay the,3735.48,3.42
image is causing a problem so let me,3737.339,5.24
just get rid of the image for a second,3738.9,3.679
this is now centered my content on the,3742.68,4.32
page you can see that automatically left,3745.319,3.961
and right margins get added for the page,3747.0,4.38
so that's great and you can see that the,3749.28,3.66
fonts have also changed fonts are also,3751.38,3.3
looking nice text is looking nicer more,3752.94,4.139
modern so that's all nice the image was,3754.68,3.72
causing a problem so let me add back,3757.079,3.421
that image and let me see what I can do,3758.4,6.719
about images let's see here images so,3760.5,6.9
images are made responsive by adding the,3765.119,4.561
IMG fluid class so what if I just do,3767.4,4.919
this if I just take this and give my,3769.68,5.24
image a class,3772.319,2.601
IMG fluid,3777.9,3.08
okay and now this image is rendering,3781.859,4.98
nicely now of course I may still want to,3784.26,4.74
do some more styling on my own so under,3786.839,4.081
the link tag I can still open up a style,3789.0,3.119
tag,3790.92,4.02
and let me give this image the ID Banner,3792.119,4.98
so it already has the ID Banner,3794.94,6.6
so let me now still limit its height to,3797.099,8.581
360 pixels let me set its object fit,3801.54,7.44
cover I may also want to send the width,3805.68,4.619
so width,3808.98,4.22
100 percent,3810.299,2.901
yep the image is looking nice now I want,3813.48,4.26
to Center this now how do we Center it,3815.64,4.979
now let's see here if I go back here and,3817.74,4.859
maybe search for I can always do this,3820.619,5.22
command K and let me just search Center,3822.599,6.841
and let's see text Center,3825.839,7.141
or Center text,3829.44,5.82
yep so looks like there is some text,3832.98,4.079
alignment classes so if you want to,3835.26,3.299
Center some text all we need to do is,3837.059,3.961
provide the class text Center so if I,3838.559,4.321
come back here and I just want to Center,3841.02,5.48
this heading so I say class,3842.88,3.62
text Center,3846.599,5.041
and now that is Centered for us and,3849.059,4.441
similarly for the,3851.64,3.959
H2 as well I'm going to provide the,3853.5,4.38
class text Center that's going to Center,3855.599,3.621
that,3857.88,6.199
and let's provide text Center,3859.22,4.859
and that's going to Center that,3865.74,4.68
it's looking nice I think one thing that,3868.559,3.54
I also want to do is maybe make this,3870.42,4.5
text a little bigger so let's see,3872.099,4.321
let's go up here I think there is,3874.92,4.62
another section on typography somewhere,3876.42,6.179
we have content typography and here we,3879.54,6.6
have headings and here we have,3882.599,5.941
lead this this looks interesting I like,3886.14,4.32
this so there seems to be a class called,3888.54,4.38
lead that I can add to a paragraph,3890.46,4.139
so I'm going to come into this paragraph,3892.92,4.8
and I'm going to add the class,3894.599,6.98
lead and that looks nice,3897.72,3.859
you can see that this has become bigger,3902.819,3.841
this is nice I may want to add some,3904.5,5.16
spacing above this some margins so I can,3906.66,4.98
again come in here and maybe press,3909.66,4.919
command K margin margin and padding,3911.64,5.28
so looks like there are these classes M1,3914.579,4.441
M2 P1 P2 that can be used for applying,3916.92,5.1
margins so Mt is used for applying a top,3919.02,5.339
margin I can use a class number zero one,3922.02,4.98
two three four or something like that 0,3924.359,6.0
1 2 3 4 5 to apply some margins so I can,3927.0,6.359
go in here into this H1 and I can say,3930.359,5.041
class text Center and then give a space,3933.359,5.041
and empty for margin top and give,3935.4,4.62
spacing above,3938.4,4.14
you see there is some space above and,3940.02,5.819
similarly MB for margin bottom and give,3942.54,6.259
some space below,3945.839,2.96
maybe make that mb4,3948.9,3.86
that's nice and I'm going to do the same,3953.46,5.339
thing here Mt margin top two so we are,3955.74,5.94
applying a class mt2 to this H2 and,3958.799,5.221
inside the bootstrap.css file there is a,3961.68,4.08
rule that says whenever you see the,3964.02,4.68
class mt2 apply a margin to the top and,3965.76,5.64
M before apply margin to the bottom this,3968.7,5.22
is the H2 let me apply it for this H2 as,3971.4,4.64
well,3973.92,2.12
all right this is already looking much,3978.359,4.5
better let's fix the button as well so,3980.22,5.04
button,3982.859,4.26
looks like there are these nice button,3985.26,3.779
classes here let me see if I can find a,3987.119,4.141
nice large button okay I want to make my,3989.039,3.601
contact button look like this so I'm,3991.26,3.18
just going to copy this button button,3992.64,3.6
primary button large,3994.44,6.599
and let me just put that class,3996.24,8.18
on the contact button,4001.039,3.381
and now the contact button is quite,4004.52,5.22
large and I can now put the class text,4006.5,5.96
Center here,4009.74,2.72
and that's nice now the copyright well,4016.4,4.38
maybe we want to add some spacing about,4019.16,4.86
the copyrights I'm going to type mt4,4020.78,5.279
and that's going to just give some space,4024.02,4.38
above the copyright,4026.059,4.5
all right so this is looking relatively,4028.4,3.959
much nicer we haven't added the jobs,4030.559,5.04
here but that's a quick introduction to,4032.359,6.601
HTML CSS and how to use an external,4035.599,5.52
framework like bootstrap for faster,4038.96,3.3
development,4041.119,3.96
now again you don't need to remember any,4042.26,5.52
of this all you need to do is go to,4045.079,5.341
bootstrap look in the sidebar for what,4047.78,5.819
you want to do and then simply look at,4050.42,6.0
an example and copy over the styles from,4053.599,5.101
that example that's a very quick way to,4056.42,4.08
build very powerful websites bootstrap,4058.7,3.599
also a support for sidebars it also,4060.5,4.02
supports for nav bars and all so what,4062.299,4.381
we've done so far is we set up a flask,4064.52,4.319
project we created a project on GitHub,4066.68,5.159
we opened it up on replit all different,4068.839,4.621
tools but they're just there to make our,4071.839,4.081
work easier we then created and ran a,4073.46,5.7
flask server then we saw how to push,4075.92,6.0
changes back to GitHub then we created a,4079.16,4.679
template so remember we put it inside,4081.92,4.5
the templates folder and then we,4083.839,4.321
rendered the template in the app using,4086.42,3.419
render template,4088.16,4.74
then we styled the page using CSS,4089.839,4.381
classes,4092.9,4.799
and then we used bootstrap to make our,4094.22,5.34
development faster so that we don't have,4097.699,3.421
to write a lot of CSS we don't have to,4099.56,4.38
become designers the bootstrap team can,4101.12,4.86
take care of that for us,4103.94,5.04
now let's talk about how to show Dynamic,4105.98,6.12
data on a web page,4108.98,5.64
it may not be a good idea to just list,4112.1,6.119
all the jobs directly in the HTML file,4114.62,5.46
because every time we want to add a new,4118.219,3.6
job we'll have to go into the HTML file,4120.08,3.179
and change something and every time we,4121.819,3.42
have to remove a job we'll have to go,4123.259,3.361
into the HTML file and change something,4125.239,3.181
and making changes directly inside an,4126.62,4.8
HTML file can be tricky often what is,4128.42,5.16
done is the data is stored somewhere,4131.42,4.74
else in a database where administrators,4133.58,4.86
can directly just create jobs within,4136.16,4.26
that database and then information is,4138.44,5.399
fetched from a database and entered into,4140.42,6.12
an HTML file and then displayed on the,4143.839,6.121
screen and sent to the browser so,4146.54,4.92
we are not going to connect to a,4149.96,3.719
database just yet but we are going to,4151.46,4.379
simulate something similar so I'm going,4153.679,4.921
to create a python list called jobs,4155.839,4.621
inside which I'm going to store the,4158.6,3.659
information about the jobs that I want,4160.46,3.779
to keep track of and I'm going to give,4162.259,4.08
each job an ID so I'm going to give this,4164.239,4.861
job an id1 and let's give the title of,4166.339,6.621
this job data analyst,4169.1,3.86
and let's set the location of this job,4173.839,6.261
to,4178.64,4.82
Bengaluru India,4180.1,3.36
and then let's set the salary as well,4184.1,6.86
let's set that to maybe rupees 10 lakhs,4187.759,5.881
and let's create a few more of these so,4190.96,4.779
let me copy this over,4193.64,7.26
let me add a data scientist role here,4195.739,9.621
and let's change this to Delhi,4200.9,4.46
that was 10 lakhs and that is 15 lakhs,4206.36,6.0
and then let's add another job maybe,4209.84,4.62
let's change the ID here as well,4212.36,3.6
so this is the kind of information that,4214.46,2.58
you would typically get out of a,4215.96,2.52
database but for now we're just storing,4217.04,4.8
it in a variable so let's maybe put this,4218.48,7.98
and call this front-end engineer,4221.84,7.859
and let's make that remote,4226.46,8.88
and let's make that 12 and let's put in,4229.699,9.02
backend engineer,4235.34,3.379
and let's put in here,4240.86,6.12
San Francisco USA,4243.8,5.64
and that will be in dollars so let's,4246.98,6.06
just change that to Dollar 120,4249.44,5.7
000.,4253.04,3.72
so now we have information about the,4255.14,4.38
jobs now we somehow want to send this,4256.76,6.6
information into the home.html template,4259.52,6.659
and the way to do it is by providing,4263.36,4.68
arguments into render templates so let's,4266.179,3.661
provide an argument called jobs and you,4268.04,3.179
can call these arguments anything you,4269.84,4.5
want so let's provide this jobs argument,4271.219,5.46
and into this jobs argument let us pass,4274.34,5.7
the value of this list of dictionaries,4276.679,7.261
so now I can go in here in home.html and,4280.04,5.28
now here we have this place where we,4283.94,3.239
want to show the jobs,4285.32,5.339
I can come back here and here now I can,4287.179,5.581
use some special syntax now this is not,4290.659,5.161
HTML this is not CSS this is something,4292.76,5.82
that flask has provided it is called a,4295.82,5.7
templating syntax it is a way to insert,4298.58,5.94
Dynamic data into your HTML into your,4301.52,4.86
CSS so I'm going to use these curly,4304.52,4.34
brackets and here I'm going to put jobs,4306.38,6.12
bracket bracket jobs,4308.86,5.56
so you see what happened,4312.5,5.64
whatever was there inside the jobs,4314.42,5.819
list which was passed as the argument,4318.14,3.24
jobs,4320.239,5.881
is now accessible inside home.html using,4321.38,7.08
these double curly brackets we've passed,4326.12,4.26
the list and that list got converted,4328.46,3.6
into a string and then all of that is,4330.38,3.66
going to be showing here but instead if,4332.06,3.48
you wanted to pass something else let's,4334.04,5.46
say if I go back here and I pass,4335.54,6.36
company name maybe this site supports,4339.5,3.9
multiple companies so company name,4341.9,3.36
equals Jovian,4343.4,5.04
and now instead of,4345.26,7.08
me rendering Jovian careers first let me,4348.44,6.42
just render careers,4352.34,6.18
so it just renders careers but now,4354.86,6.6
oops not here this is the page title we,4358.52,6.179
want to get the yeah here instead of,4361.46,5.759
rendering Jovian couriers in the H1 let,4364.699,5.161
me first just render careers,4367.219,5.641
and now let me add a template tag and,4369.86,5.16
let me get company name,4372.86,3.96
so remember I'm passing something called,4375.02,5.34
company name in app.pi here so now I can,4376.82,5.399
access company name by using these,4380.36,3.54
double curly brackets and now it is,4382.219,3.901
showing Jovian careers so this is the,4383.9,4.74
way you pass Dynamic information into,4386.12,4.559
the HTML templates and that is why these,4388.64,3.539
are called templates these are not going,4390.679,3.181
to always be shown the same way because,4392.179,3.181
then we'd have to create a whole bunch,4393.86,3.54
of files for every page that we want to,4395.36,3.839
show these are going to be filled in,4397.4,3.6
with a certain information using these,4399.199,3.061
tags,4401.0,3.54
so that's how tags work now the trouble,4402.26,3.78
is we don't want to show information,4404.54,3.74
like this if we look back at our,4406.04,4.98
excalator wireframe we want to show,4408.28,4.78
information like this this is much nicer,4411.02,5.159
how do we do that well template support,4413.06,6.119
some special syntax as well we can,4416.179,5.101
actually use a for Loop inside template,4419.179,4.5
so we can say for,4421.28,6.84
job in jobs so we want to get each job,4423.679,6.661
out of the jobs list remember jobs is a,4428.12,4.619
list jobs is a list containing many,4430.34,6.66
dictionaries or objects so for job in,4432.739,7.261
jobs and then we end the for by writing,4437.0,5.04
and for so everything else is going to,4440.0,3.6
be inside,4442.04,2.94
and by the way this is just a good,4443.6,3.0
practice whenever you open a tag it's,4444.98,3.66
always a good idea to First close it and,4446.6,3.84
then move your cursor back inside so,4448.64,4.2
that you can keep track otherwise you,4450.44,5.04
forget things so for job and job so now,4452.84,5.16
job is going to contain each individual,4455.48,4.92
job and let me just for nuance render,4458.0,4.56
Insider div,4460.4,4.68
let me render,4462.56,4.26
and let me change this also to a div,4465.08,4.02
this is not exactly a paragraph so to,4466.82,4.98
speak so let me just render job now job,4469.1,4.559
is a dictionary python dictionary and,4471.8,4.26
from the job let me get what information,4473.659,4.981
can I get let me just render job title,4476.06,6.679
okay so job title,4478.64,4.099
let's see now,4482.78,3.84
all right so now we've introduced a for,4484.34,5.1
Loop using this special syntax and now,4486.62,4.68
inside the for Loop we have access to,4489.44,4.5
the job variable which in each Loop,4491.3,5.46
takes the value of the specific job and,4493.94,4.98
then we have this title that we are,4496.76,3.66
extracting out of the job variable so,4498.92,3.239
that's nice now let's style it a little,4500.42,5.16
bit let's make it look like this so let,4502.159,6.06
me have this div here like I already,4505.58,7.4
have and let me make this an H4,4508.219,4.761
and then below it let me render the,4514.94,5.82
information about,4518.659,6.0
the job location,4520.76,3.899
and let me just type the word location,4526.46,4.08
here to make it super clear that I'm,4528.5,3.84
talking about location,4530.54,4.86
okay location Bengaluru India looking,4532.34,5.879
good let me make this bold so one quick,4535.4,5.22
way to make things bold in HTML is using,4538.219,5.281
the B tag again something you can very,4540.62,5.4
easily look up how to make text bold in,4543.5,5.0
HTML,4546.02,2.48
great looks nice I'm just going to set,4549.199,6.841
style equals,4553.219,5.581
color RGB,4556.04,6.48
and 120 120 120,4558.8,7.1
to give it a nice gray color,4562.52,3.38
we may need some spacing right now the,4566.36,3.24
spacing is a little messed up so I'm,4568.04,6.119
going to go back into this H4 tag and,4569.6,8.72
I am going to just give it margin bottom,4574.159,8.181
4px let's just see,4578.32,4.02
and I am going to go into this div tag,4583.04,4.139
and I'm going to give it,4585.38,5.52
margin bottom,4587.179,6.54
16px,4590.9,4.86
I could also use bootstrap classes here,4593.719,4.561
but this was just easier to do I've got,4595.76,6.78
the location in here now let me put in,4598.28,7.08
let's put in maybe the salary as well so,4602.54,5.46
let's put salary,4605.36,4.62
jobs salary,4608.0,3.9
foreign,4609.98,4.38
and there you go now we have the salary,4611.9,3.6
as well,4614.36,3.48
what if salary is not mentioned for a,4615.5,4.14
certain role what happens then so let's,4617.84,3.839
say this one does not have a salary the,4619.64,4.98
front-end engineer role,4621.679,5.821
so looks like it rendered empty so how,4624.62,5.16
about we go back here and handle that,4627.5,4.62
just like you have four you can also use,4629.78,5.1
if so I'm going to put an if tag here so,4632.12,3.96
percent,4634.88,2.339
if,4636.08,2.7
percent,4637.219,5.101
salary if the key salary,4638.78,6.48
is present in the dictionary job,4642.32,5.28
then render this div otherwise don't,4645.26,4.08
render it,4647.6,5.66
and then we have to do an end if,4649.34,3.92
so now you can see here front end,4654.679,3.721
engineer just says location remote now,4656.12,4.14
one thing you might want to do is this,4658.4,3.779
same job information you may want to,4660.26,5.28
render on other Pages as well so what we,4662.179,4.861
can do is we can take this layout,4665.54,4.32
everything inside the four and I can,4667.04,7.58
create a new layout let me call this,4669.86,4.76
job item dot HTML and I'll just put this,4674.659,5.221
here,4678.92,4.44
and let me just adjust the,4679.88,5.339
indentation indentation is very,4683.36,3.299
important to understand the structure of,4685.219,3.621
the code and now let's come back to home,4686.659,5.941
and now inside the for instead of having,4688.84,6.58
all that HTML I can just use,4692.6,4.619
include,4695.42,5.96
job item dot HTML,4697.219,4.161
so this is a nice way to organize the,4702.5,3.96
information so you can see here that,4705.02,3.36
inside home.html if I don't have this,4706.46,3.0
include,4708.38,3.839
the jobs will not be rendered,4709.46,5.34
no open positions but once I include,4712.219,5.221
what we are telling flask is,4714.8,5.52
inside the for Loop each time with the,4717.44,5.1
different value of job include the,4720.32,4.56
template job item.html and pass the,4722.54,4.199
variables that are available in this,4724.88,4.02
template to that template,4726.739,4.5
now you can structure your templates you,4728.9,4.799
can extract reusable components out of,4731.239,6.0
your templates and render,4733.699,6.901
a nice layout one other thing we want to,4737.239,5.101
see here is,4740.6,4.26
this apply button and then this bottom,4742.34,4.92
border so let's add those as well adding,4744.86,3.839
the bottom border is going to be easy,4747.26,3.24
I'm just going to try looking at,4748.699,4.02
bootstrap here borders,4750.5,4.02
so let's see if you want to add a border,4752.719,3.541
at the bottom we just say class border,4754.52,2.94
bottom,4756.26,5.22
so if I go here and inside job item.html,4757.46,7.86
I can now pass in,4761.48,6.36
class,4765.32,4.8
border bottom and let's see what that,4767.84,4.14
does,4770.12,3.84
okay so now you can see that under the,4771.98,4.56
job there is a border I may want some,4773.96,6.18
spacing so remember the Box model if you,4776.54,5.88
want some spacing outside the Border you,4780.14,4.14
use something called margin and if you,4782.42,3.6
want some spacing inside the Border you,4784.28,3.959
use something called padding it's just,4786.02,4.62
different terms don't get too confused,4788.239,3.841
about it something that you can look up,4790.64,3.72
but I'm going to just put a padding,4792.08,4.139
bottom because I want some space inside,4794.36,3.72
the border and I'm going to set the,4796.219,4.081
padding bottom to 4px,4798.08,4.56
and let's see what that does,4800.3,5.1
oh sorry not here I should have it in,4802.64,5.42
the div,4805.4,2.66
all right so you can see that some space,4809.96,3.36
has come up here let me change that to,4811.64,4.92
8px and see maybe that looks nicer 8px,4813.32,5.04
that looks nicer so let's reload the,4816.56,4.619
page and let's see what we have here so,4818.36,5.1
now we have data analyst and now we have,4821.179,3.901
data scientist now we have front-end,4823.46,3.36
engineer and back-end engineer and we,4825.08,3.659
have a separation as well,4826.82,4.14
one last thing we just need that apply,4828.739,4.321
button over here let's try to add a,4830.96,4.38
button first let me go into command K,4833.06,3.78
button,4835.34,4.92
and let's see this is too bright so I,4836.84,5.339
want to use maybe something like this,4840.26,4.02
and this looks like just,4842.179,5.341
this so I can just copy this over come,4844.28,6.24
in here and let me add that button here,4847.52,7.08
let me call it apply,4850.52,7.62
Now by default HTML renders information,4854.6,5.7
top to bottom so you can see that the,4858.14,4.68
button came up at the bottom here,4860.3,4.439
but what we want to do ideally is we,4862.82,3.96
want to create two columns inside each,4864.739,4.44
job listing so one column is going to be,4866.78,4.8
the information about the job and one,4869.179,4.381
column is going to be the apply button,4871.58,4.68
and that's where you can create columns,4873.56,5.04
in bootstrap so let's see,4876.26,4.74
how to create columns so we want to,4878.6,3.66
create something like this we want to,4881.0,3.659
create two columns and maybe we want to,4882.26,4.8
create like one big column and one small,4884.659,5.341
column and the way you create columns is,4887.06,6.42
using the call class so looks like I can,4890.0,5.46
use call 9 to create a very wide column,4893.48,4.14
and then maybe I can use like call 3 or,4895.46,4.44
something to create a small column let,4897.62,5.039
me just try that so let me just put,4899.9,4.68
all of this,4902.659,4.981
inside a div everything except the,4904.58,6.84
button I'm going to put inside a div,4907.64,6.18
so the H4,4911.42,5.16
then the div location and then the,4913.82,4.98
salary all of this is inside a div and,4916.58,6.96
I'm going to say class equals call,4918.8,7.379
9 so this is going to take up nine,4923.54,4.74
spaces out of 12. so bootstrap has,4926.179,3.661
something called a 12 column layout so,4928.28,3.72
the entire space left to right is,4929.84,4.68
divided into 12 columns and you can,4932.0,4.98
specify for each div how many columns,4934.52,4.08
you wanted to take,4936.98,5.94
and here let me call this,4938.6,6.42
class,4942.92,4.92
call three,4945.02,5.58
nine columns I'm assigning to the,4947.84,4.14
information and then three columns I'm,4950.6,2.7
assigning to the button and we'll play,4951.98,5.1
with that let's see what that does,4953.3,5.52
okay it still doesn't do anything I,4957.08,3.48
think the columns have to be inside a,4958.82,4.919
row so we need a div with the class row,4960.56,5.88
so let me just give this the class Row,4963.739,5.361
the outer div,4966.44,2.66
and suddenly now it's looking much nicer,4969.44,4.259
so now we have data analyst location,4972.26,2.82
Bengaluru,4973.699,3.121
I've just copied over some information,4975.08,4.139
from here how to create columns so first,4976.82,4.5
we create a row and then we create two,4979.219,4.321
columns within that row so if we first,4981.32,3.72
we create a row and then we create two,4983.54,3.48
columns within that Row one column has,4985.04,3.78
the width nine and one column has a,4987.02,3.96
width three and you can also play with,4988.82,4.379
this you can maybe make this width 2 and,4990.98,4.56
you can make this width 10 but if you go,4993.199,3.96
beyond 12 it is just going to again,4995.54,3.42
break into the next line,4997.159,5.821
but this looks nice so now we have,4998.96,6.18
this nice data analyst and then we have,5002.98,3.719
apply and everything,5005.14,3.599
and I think it'll be nice to get the,5006.699,4.921
apply maybe on the right instead of on,5008.739,5.401
the left and also maybe vertically,5011.62,5.82
centered but as of now it looks fine it,5014.14,5.519
doesn't look bad so now we have some,5017.44,4.44
Dynamic data that we have rendered so we,5019.659,4.921
have taken information that was stored,5021.88,5.64
inside this list,5024.58,4.5
we have passed it into the render,5027.52,4.02
template as a variable and of course,5029.08,4.98
we've also passed this other,5031.54,4.86
variable company name,5034.06,5.46
and then inside the home template we are,5036.4,5.16
using a for Loop where we are getting,5039.52,4.38
values out of the jobs variable into job,5041.56,4.5
and then we are passing it into this,5043.9,4.5
other template called job item.html,5046.06,4.74
where we are actually using information,5048.4,4.86
from inside the job item and here we are,5050.8,5.22
also using an if it's a lot going on,5053.26,5.28
here but it's all just things that you,5056.02,5.04
can do step by step and then just look,5058.54,4.56
at the appropriate documentation or just,5061.06,4.08
search online to figure out how 90,5063.1,3.48
percent of web development is probably,5065.14,3.78
just looking things up online nobody,5066.58,5.4
remembers all this from scratch,5068.92,5.04
so that's done,5071.98,4.739
so that's one way to return Dynamic data,5073.96,5.52
one other way that some websites allow,5076.719,5.101
you to access some Dynamic data is using,5079.48,5.52
an API instead of returning HTML we can,5081.82,5.839
also return some Json Json is simply,5085.0,5.88
JavaScript objects so let me create,5087.659,5.5
another function called list Jobs first,5090.88,5.52
I'm going to register this at the route,5093.159,5.881
slash jobs and I'm going to take the,5096.4,5.04
jobs information I'm going to convert it,5099.04,5.34
into a Json string so for that there is,5101.44,6.299
this helper function called jsonify all,5104.38,4.92
it does is it takes any object and,5107.739,4.201
converts it into a Json object so,5109.3,5.7
jsonify and give it jobs,5111.94,5.58
and now we have a second route so now we,5115.0,4.679
have a second URL that we have added in,5117.52,5.159
our server so now if I go back here and,5119.679,5.52
I open this in a new tab and then open,5122.679,4.921
slash jobs if you see I've added slash,5125.199,4.441
jobs at the end you can see that now,5127.6,5.639
I've sent this information as Json,5129.64,6.78
when people say rest API or Json API or,5133.239,5.821
API endpoint this is what they mean that,5136.42,4.68
your web server is returning some,5139.06,5.22
information not just as HTML this is the,5141.1,5.76
HTML version of that information but the,5144.28,4.74
same information is also accessible in,5146.86,4.319
the form of Json in the form where it's,5149.02,3.42
just the data and then you can do,5151.179,4.321
whatever you want with the data so I'll,5152.44,4.68
tell you quick secret now you can go to,5155.5,4.26
job AI slash akashians for example and,5157.12,4.5
you can get this page containing all of,5159.76,4.919
my information or you can go to jobin.ai,5161.62,4.619
API,5164.679,4.861
slash user slash Akash NS,5166.239,5.581
and you can get the same information in,5169.54,4.86
Json format so if you want to view,5171.82,6.12
information about me you can look at the,5174.4,5.779
Jovian page or if you want to just,5177.94,4.02
programmatically extract the information,5180.179,3.04
about me maybe you want to,5181.96,2.4
programmatically extract information,5183.219,3.241
about thousand users and you have their,5184.36,4.2
usernames then you can simply invoke,5186.46,5.279
this Json endpoint or this Json route,5188.56,5.579
and get all that data as Json and maybe,5191.739,4.98
create a CSV out of it and analyze it so,5194.139,4.56
the only difference between creating an,5196.719,4.261
HTML endpoint and between creating a,5198.699,4.621
Json endpoint is that instead of,5200.98,4.08
rendering a template you're just using,5203.32,5.64
jsonify and often just to differentiate,5205.06,6.78
between HTML pages and non-html Pages we,5208.96,5.4
often tend to put this API name in front,5211.84,4.319
of it API stands for application,5214.36,3.6
programming interface,5216.159,4.741
but what it really means is just a URL,5217.96,5.64
which does not return HTML to be shown,5220.9,5.04
on the browser but it returns some,5223.6,3.96
structured data in the form of Json,5225.94,3.299
which can then be programmatically,5227.56,4.32
analyzed so now we've created our first,5229.239,5.281
API route we've created our HTML Rod,5231.88,4.2
we've created our API route and this,5234.52,3.659
information right now is stored in a,5236.08,3.78
variable but it could very well be,5238.179,5.161
coming from a database okay now enough,5239.86,5.58
building I think this website is looking,5243.34,4.859
reasonable so let's now deploy this,5245.44,4.739
website to the cloud,5248.199,4.081
it is already deployed in some sense it,5250.179,3.901
is on replit but as I mentioned in the,5252.28,3.66
beginning replied is better suited for,5254.08,3.54
development your Rebel can shut down,5255.94,4.98
anytime because it's free resources and,5257.62,6.0
it doesn't really handle large workloads,5260.92,4.56
because it's doing a lot of things to,5263.62,4.079
help you develop more easily so now when,5265.48,3.84
you want to put it into production you,5267.699,3.301
will have to figure out some Cloud,5269.32,3.18
platform where you're going to deploy,5271.0,4.02
this one Cloud platform that makes it,5272.5,4.98
really easy to deploy python,5275.02,5.28
applications is called render.com there,5277.48,4.32
are other Cloud platforms like Amazon,5280.3,4.439
web services and Heroku and Google cloud,5281.8,5.58
and Azure but render is really easy to,5284.739,3.781
work with so that's why I want to show,5287.38,3.18
you how to work with render.com,5288.52,6.48
so first I'm going to take my app.pi and,5290.56,5.76
I am going to then go into Version,5295.0,2.639
Control,5296.32,3.12
and I'm going to say,5297.639,4.5
added Dynamic data,5299.44,4.56
and API route,5302.139,5.961
and then I'm going to commit and push,5304.0,4.1
and now this information is sent back to,5308.679,4.201
GitHub so now I'm no longer concerned,5310.6,3.78
with replit now all my information has,5312.88,3.0
gone into GitHub,5314.38,3.779
so now jobin careers website if I open,5315.88,5.279
up app.pi seems to contain all the,5318.159,5.401
information that I have put in so far,5321.159,5.221
now I want to take this GitHub project,5323.56,5.82
and deploy it on render.com,5326.38,4.56
and the way I'm going to do it is go to,5329.38,4.5
render.com and create an account and,5330.94,4.92
it's free to get started there's a free,5333.88,3.779
plan that you can use so create an,5335.86,3.54
account,5337.659,3.721
and once you've created an account you,5339.4,4.2
will see this dashboard and on this,5341.38,4.56
dashboard you can click new and we want,5343.6,3.66
to create what's called a web service,5345.94,4.86
which means we are not just sending some,5347.26,5.28
HTML normally we're maybe also,5350.8,3.359
connecting to a database and getting,5352.54,4.02
some Dynamic data Maybe we also have,5354.159,3.901
some API routes and things like that so,5356.56,3.54
we want to create a web service a static,5358.06,4.02
site is just a set of HTML pages that,5360.1,4.26
you want to deploy no flask nothing but,5362.08,4.5
if you want to create a web service and,5364.36,5.46
here we need to allow render.com to pull,5366.58,5.7
your code so that's where we can click,5369.82,5.16
connect account and on clicking connect,5372.28,4.56
account once again we are asked which,5374.98,3.84
organization or which account we want to,5376.84,3.66
use so I want to do it on my personal,5378.82,4.2
account and I want to give it access to,5380.5,5.639
only the German careers website and I'm,5383.02,5.34
going to just click install,5386.139,6.02
and this will ask me for my password,5388.36,3.799
and now you can see this repository is,5393.04,3.72
connected,5395.739,3.601
so now let me click connect,5396.76,4.56
now when we click connect we have to,5399.34,4.5
just configure this deployment okay now,5401.32,4.2
we are going to take the code that is,5403.84,2.94
there on GitHub and we're going to,5405.52,3.9
deploy it on the cloud using render so,5406.78,4.98
we need to configure it first thing here,5409.42,4.56
I am going to give this a name let me,5411.76,4.62
just call it Jovian careers website this,5413.98,5.159
is a name for internal reference then,5416.38,4.68
environment is Python 3 that's fine,5419.139,4.861
region is Oregon it doesn't matter it's,5421.06,4.92
basically where in the world the server,5424.0,4.98
is going to be located branch is main,5425.98,5.52
that is the main branch on GitHub where,5428.98,4.08
we are developing,5431.5,4.62
and then it requires a build command so,5433.06,5.579
remember we installed flask at the,5436.12,3.42
beginning,5438.639,3.06
render.com doesn't know that it needs to,5439.54,4.74
install flask so what we need to do for,5441.699,5.101
render.com is to create a special file,5444.28,5.7
called requirements.txt,5446.8,5.339
and it's not that render requires this,5449.98,4.02
file it is a standard in the python,5452.139,4.201
ecosystem that anytime you have a python,5454.0,5.1
project and you want to specify that it,5456.34,5.16
requires certain libraries the project,5459.1,4.139
requires certain libraries it's a,5461.5,3.12
convention to put that information,5463.239,4.261
inside a requirements.txt file so I'm,5464.62,4.5
going to add a requirement here called,5467.5,3.06
flask,5469.12,3.36
so that's the one library that needs to,5470.56,5.04
be installed on the server and second I,5472.48,5.06
am also going to add another Library,5475.6,6.42
called G unicorn so gu and i c o r n you,5477.54,6.76
can look it up G unicorn,5482.02,5.52
so what GE unicorn does is this is a,5484.3,6.78
production server for python remember,5487.54,6.06
flask when we ran it it said that it is,5491.08,4.38
a development server don't use this for,5493.6,3.84
production so whenever you want to put a,5495.46,4.5
flask application into production you,5497.44,5.1
need to use the G unicorn Library it's,5499.96,4.5
very simple to use it's the exact same,5502.54,4.56
command every single time so we have put,5504.46,4.679
in requirements or txt flask and G,5507.1,4.68
unicorn and let me just commit that so,5509.139,5.281
let's say I,5511.78,6.6
added requirements,5514.42,3.96
Dot txt and I'm going to commit and push,5518.739,6.48
and now this is sent to my GitHub,5522.94,4.68
repository I can verify that there is a,5525.219,4.681
requirements.txt file here which,5527.62,6.18
contains flask NG unicorn so now when,5529.9,6.299
render pulls the code it is going to,5533.8,4.8
receive the requirements.txt file and,5536.199,4.141
then here it is going to run this build,5538.6,4.079
command pip install minus r,5540.34,5.879
requirements.txt all this does is it,5542.679,5.881
papers the package manager for python it,5546.219,4.261
is used to install libraries in Python,5548.56,3.72
and when you say minus our,5550.48,3.719
requirements.txt you're just telling pip,5552.28,4.379
look into the requirements.txt file and,5554.199,4.561
in each line there will be the name of a,5556.659,4.201
library and please install that library,5558.76,4.979
for me so when render pulls the code,5560.86,5.04
from GitHub every time something changes,5563.739,3.9
in the repository render pulls the code,5565.9,3.62
and then it's going to run pip install,5567.639,4.161
requirements.txt and that is going to,5569.52,4.719
obviously come across these two lines,5571.8,6.1
flask and G unicorn so then it's going,5574.239,6.9
to install those libraries and now to,5577.9,5.22
start the server we are now going to use,5581.139,4.881
G unicorn so gu and i c o r n g unicorn,5583.12,6.3
the library when it is installed it also,5586.02,5.92
adds a command called gionicon and this,5589.42,4.14
command needs to be given the name of,5591.94,3.9
the file that needs to be executed so,5593.56,4.56
the file that needs to be executed is,5595.84,5.58
app.pi so instead of doing python app.pi,5598.12,5.28
we are just doing gionicon app.pi,5601.42,4.68
development production python geonicon,5603.4,4.62
that's the only change,5606.1,5.039
so G Unicorn app dot Pi but instead of,5608.02,5.94
app.pi you just put app and then not,5611.139,6.6
only that you also have to specify the,5613.96,5.88
name of the actual variable which,5617.739,3.96
contains the flask application that you,5619.84,4.26
want to run now in my case the variable,5621.699,3.96
is also called app but let's say this,5624.1,3.42
was called flask app then I would have,5625.659,4.801
to put something different but we are,5627.52,5.219
just going to put Geo Nikon app colon,5630.46,3.3
app,5632.739,3.061
now how did I find out all this how did,5633.76,3.3
I find that this needs to be the build,5635.8,2.7
command and this needs to be the start,5637.06,4.44
command I just Googled render.com deploy,5638.5,5.34
flask application it's not something,5641.5,5.04
that I've ever learned before this is,5643.84,4.2
something that I looked up just a few,5646.54,3.54
hours ago and there is a tutorial on,5648.04,4.38
this and it literally tells you exactly,5650.08,4.38
this that there is a Hello World project,5652.42,4.02
that you can check out on GitHub and you,5654.46,4.8
can go through this app.pi file here and,5656.44,4.62
you can see this is what app.fi is set,5659.26,4.86
up as and then you create a web service,5661.06,5.22
on render after signing in and you,5664.12,4.32
should set the environment to python you,5666.28,3.62
should set the build Command Web install,5668.44,3.6
requirements.txt and you should set the,5669.9,4.6
start command to G Unicorn app colon app,5672.04,4.8
so that's literally what I looked up and,5674.5,3.739
you can see here there is a,5676.84,3.42
requirements.txt file which contains,5678.239,4.42
flask in G unicorn,5680.26,4.379
all of these things are not things that,5682.659,3.48
you have to learn or become familiar,5684.639,3.241
with or anything it's just when you need,5686.139,4.321
to connect to a specific platform you,5687.88,4.319
need to look up how to do it and that is,5690.46,3.9
often in the documentation if you are,5692.199,3.901
deploying to a platform called Heroku,5694.36,3.42
then this would be slightly different if,5696.1,3.599
you are deploying to a platform like AWS,5697.78,3.899
this would be slightly different all,5699.699,3.721
that matters is figuring out how to make,5701.679,3.721
it work so now we've put in all this,5703.42,5.219
information and now we can go in here,5705.4,4.98
and select a plan you can choose the fee,5708.639,3.181
plan I'm choosing the paid one because,5710.38,4.319
it's going to build slightly faster and,5711.82,4.379
now it is going to create a deployment,5714.699,4.141
of this application you can see that the,5716.199,3.901
application has become visible on,5718.84,4.22
jobiancareers website Dot onrender.com,5720.1,5.94
and it is first cloning the GitHub,5723.06,5.32
repository and then it is checking out,5726.04,3.96
the main branch so it's basically,5728.38,3.779
getting the latest code then it is,5730.0,3.36
telling you that it's using a certain,5732.159,3.121
version of python now it's installing a,5733.36,3.48
bunch of libraries you can see here it,5735.28,2.959
said pip install,5736.84,4.74
requirements.txt so it's done after all,5738.239,4.96
the installation is done it's is going,5741.58,3.84
to upload and deploy it so now it's,5743.199,4.5
doing a deployment and once it is,5745.42,5.52
deployed which means once it is set up,5747.699,6.301
on a server and that server is pointed,5750.94,5.64
to this URL we will be able to access it,5754.0,4.32
and how is it going to run that actual,5756.58,3.42
server it's going to run the server by,5758.32,5.6
using gionicon App colon app,5760.0,3.92
create looks like it has started so now,5764.38,4.74
I can go up here and I can open this and,5766.78,4.62
I can go in a new tab,5769.12,4.2
and there it is this is the jobin,5771.4,5.16
careers website deployed on render.com,5773.32,6.359
but what I don't like is that it's on,5776.56,5.099
this Jovian couriers website dot,5779.679,3.741
onrender.com I want my own site,5781.659,3.661
jovincareers.com or something so we'll,5783.42,3.819
talk about that in just a second but,5785.32,4.62
what I want to show you now is how easy,5787.239,4.801
it is to change things now you can come,5789.94,5.94
back here and let me maybe change some,5792.04,5.76
information here from backend engineer,5795.88,4.08
let me change this to 150 000 maybe also,5797.8,6.439
let me go into the home.html file,5799.96,6.96
templatehome.html and here maybe let me,5804.239,3.761
change,5806.92,3.0
instead of open positions let me call,5808.0,4.76
this job openings,5809.92,2.84
and let me just,5813.46,5.64
go to Version Control and let me say,5815.62,6.36
made some changes,5819.1,6.48
and let me just commit and push,5821.98,5.46
and now those changes are going to come,5825.58,3.54
up here,5827.44,3.779
if I just reload again it says made some,5829.12,5.4
changes 10 seconds ago and now if I come,5831.219,5.401
back here and I go into,5834.52,3.719
the website again,5836.62,3.42
you see that it has started a new,5838.239,4.801
deployment so every time you push to the,5840.04,4.8
main branch render will automatically,5843.04,3.72
take that and try to deploy it and if,5844.84,3.72
the deploy fails it will continue to use,5846.76,3.24
the previous deploy if the deploy,5848.56,3.54
succeeds then the site will get replaced,5850.0,4.08
now suppose for some reason this does,5852.1,3.36
not get triggered you can just click,5854.08,3.599
manual deploy and deploy latest commit,5855.46,3.96
and that is going to take the latest,5857.679,3.781
code and that is going to deploy it so,5859.42,5.58
this way you can just work on replit and,5861.46,5.52
test your changes on the test server,5865.0,5.52
then use Version Control to push your,5866.98,5.88
changes to git and render will pick up,5870.52,4.44
those latest changes and automatically,5872.86,4.92
deploy them see how easy it is to update,5874.96,4.02
your website,5877.78,2.7
so now we've seen how to set up,5878.98,4.02
automated deployment each time,5880.48,5.1
something changes so I believe we change,5883.0,4.08
this to job openings and you can see it,5885.58,3.059
has already changed to job openings here,5887.08,5.22
now let's learn how to deploy it to a,5888.639,6.961
nice website like jobin careers.com,5892.3,5.399
now this is where you will need to buy a,5895.6,3.36
domain this part is not free,5897.699,3.601
unfortunately because you need to buy a,5898.96,3.12
domain so you can go to,5901.3,2.58
domains.google.com,5902.08,3.9
and on domains.google.com you can,5903.88,4.08
actually click get a new domain and I,5905.98,5.58
can search for example jovincareers.com,5907.96,5.699
and looks like it is available and it is,5911.56,5.099
rupees 860 per year so I can actually go,5913.659,4.5
ahead and buy it so I can click this,5916.659,3.301
button add my payment information and,5918.159,3.361
buy it and so on,5919.96,4.16
I've already bought another one called,5921.52,6.54
jovencareers.xyz and once I have bought,5924.12,7.84
it I can configure it to,5928.06,6.659
display this website how do I do it,5931.96,4.8
again every platform every deployment,5934.719,3.601
platform will have its own way of doing,5936.76,5.04
it but on render.com if I go into the,5938.32,5.22
project settings here,5941.8,4.14
and on the project settings just find,5943.54,4.32
the place where it talks about domains,5945.94,4.14
so looks like custom domains and you can,5947.86,5.1
point a custom domain to this app so I,5950.08,7.92
want to point Jovian careers.xyz,5952.96,5.04
let's save that,5958.48,3.44
and now once you add the domain jobin,5962.02,6.06
careers.xyz then it will ask you to,5965.139,5.641
update a DNS record don't need to worry,5968.08,4.559
about what exactly this means you just,5970.78,3.959
have to follow some instructions here so,5972.639,4.981
it says add a cname record for www,5974.739,6.0
pointing to this and add a,5977.62,5.7
a name record pointing to this so I'm,5980.739,4.92
just going to copy this thing and I'm,5983.32,4.379
going to go here into my Google domain,5985.659,4.621
I'm going to click manage,5987.699,6.421
and I am going to click on DNS and I am,5990.28,5.58
going to add a record right that's what,5994.12,3.96
it said add a DNS record,5995.86,5.279
so I need to add a cname record for www,5998.08,5.76
so I'm going to select record type,6001.139,6.6
cname and www,6003.84,6.54
and then I am going to put the value,6007.739,5.341
Jovian careers website dot onrender.com,6010.38,6.0
here and I click save,6013.08,5.94
so that's one let's add one more looks,6016.38,4.859
like I need to add one more record,6019.02,4.86
so now I need to add another record and,6021.239,4.201
this time it needs to be an a name or,6023.88,3.42
Alias record let's see if we have a name,6025.44,3.9
or Alias okay there's no a name there's,6027.3,3.3
no alias,6029.34,3.299
then it says that okay do not have a,6030.6,4.38
name or release then use an a record so,6032.639,4.381
now I need to create an a record so I'll,6034.98,4.739
just go here I'll create a it's just,6037.02,5.58
already pointing to jovencareers.xyz so,6039.719,4.081
I don't need to put anything here,6042.6,2.82
because that's going to just create a,6043.8,4.08
subdomain and then it needs an address,6045.42,4.62
so I need to copy this address and I,6047.88,4.14
need to paste this address here,6050.04,3.96
and then I click save,6052.02,4.98
and that's it so now what we have done,6054.0,5.58
is we've bought the domain and in the,6057.0,5.52
domain we have configured the DNS which,6059.58,4.44
is simply something called domain name,6062.52,3.96
server setting which means if somebody,6064.02,4.5
in the world tries to access the domain,6066.48,4.56
which location should they actually be,6068.52,4.26
going to a domain is simply a,6071.04,4.56
redirection to some actual location and,6072.78,4.62
what you said is that if somebody tries,6075.6,4.8
to access joviancareers.xyz they should,6077.4,5.1
actually be shown the information that,6080.4,3.72
comes from this page,6082.5,4.62
render.com,6084.12,3.0
so let's see looks like it has been,6087.9,4.739
verified and now if I go to Joven,6090.54,3.48
careers,6092.639,4.681
dot x y z,6094.02,5.159
you can see that the site that we have,6097.32,3.66
just created in the last couple of hours,6099.179,5.401
is now live on jovincareers.xyz,6100.98,6.12
and every time we make a change on,6104.58,3.659
replit,6107.1,4.94
let me change that back to,6108.239,3.801
open positions here,6113.1,3.26
and then we just push that to get,6117.54,5.78
open positions,6123.659,5.721
commit and push,6126.48,2.9
render is going to pick up the latest,6130.26,4.02
version and it is going to then deploy,6131.94,4.199
that latest version and that latest,6134.28,3.419
version is going to be available on,6136.139,4.56
jovencareers.xyz,6137.699,3.0
and this is something that you can do,6142.02,4.86
right now today with your own site that,6143.52,6.96
you want to do so now we have just,6146.88,4.859
completed,6150.48,4.199
rendering Dynamic data creating an API,6151.739,4.141
route,6154.679,3.301
deploying the project to render.com and,6155.88,3.48
connecting a domain with a render,6157.98,4.259
deployment now we're going to very,6159.36,5.04
quickly make some functional and,6162.239,4.261
aesthetic improvements to this site so,6164.4,4.739
that it can actually be used as a jovian,6166.5,4.8
career site so the first thing I'm going,6169.139,3.841
to do is add a nav bar in footer from,6171.3,4.379
bootstrap most websites like this one or,6172.98,5.239
like Jovian have a navbar even,6175.679,4.801
getbootstrap.com itself also has a nav,6178.219,4.541
bar Google has an app bar so how about,6180.48,4.02
we add a nav bar first,6182.76,3.3
so that it looks more like a real,6184.5,4.5
website now to get an app bar I'm going,6186.06,4.8
to go into bootstrap examples and you,6189.0,4.8
can see here there is an example,6190.86,5.4
of headers,6193.8,5.58
and I can maybe pick one of these,6196.26,5.459
the way to do this is I just click,6199.38,4.2
download examples and that's going to,6201.719,3.721
download that for me and I have it,6203.58,3.539
downloaded already,6205.44,3.9
and out of those I am interested in the,6207.119,4.921
headers example so the navbars example,6209.34,5.279
and let me just open up,6212.04,5.54
vs code,6214.619,2.961
and here under headers maybe let's add,6217.86,5.94
I like this one so maybe let's get this,6222.0,4.08
one so this is number one two three four,6223.8,3.72
five number five,6226.08,3.119
so let's see here,6227.52,3.9
this is the first one,6229.199,4.02
this is the second one this is the third,6231.42,4.259
one this is the fourth one this is the,6233.219,3.42
fifth one,6235.679,3.421
so I'm just gonna copy this and I'm,6236.639,4.381
going to come back here I am going to,6239.1,7.68
put it into a file called nav.html,6241.02,9.74
and I'm going to just paste it here,6246.78,3.98
and I'm just going to come into,6251.94,4.38
home.html and right at the very top here,6253.52,6.04
right after the body starts I'm going to,6256.32,4.44
say,6259.56,4.98
include nav.html,6260.76,3.78
and there it is you can see here that,6267.719,5.101
this nav is there now this nav is set up,6270.0,5.219
in such a way that on mobile it renders,6272.82,4.98
differently and on desktop it renders,6275.219,5.52
differently so if I just open it up here,6277.8,5.339
you can see that here it has rendered,6280.739,3.361
differently,6283.139,2.881
maybe let's pick a slightly simpler map,6284.1,4.079
now that you know how to use an app I'm,6286.02,4.44
going to just go into the docs here and,6288.179,4.801
I'm going to search for navbar,6290.46,4.86
and I'm going to pick a slightly simpler,6292.98,4.44
navbar which doesn't have these special,6295.32,4.319
qualities just very light very simple,6297.42,7.739
come back here and nav.html,6299.639,5.52
that's it and let me just change this to,6305.34,3.899
Jovian,6307.86,3.48
and looks like it's using a image as,6309.239,4.321
well so I'll just grab that image,6311.34,4.26
this is the image it's using I'm just,6313.56,5.7
going to save this image as logo.svg,6315.6,5.28
and I'm going to come back here into,6319.26,3.419
static and I'm going to upload this,6320.88,3.299
image here,6322.679,4.201
and instead of this SRC I'm just going,6324.179,5.821
to change this to slash static slash,6326.88,5.64
logo.svg,6330.0,5.52
and there you go now we have that let's,6332.52,5.28
also maybe just like we have on Jovian,6335.52,4.26
we have a white nav bar with a small,6337.8,4.2
Shadow how do we get a shadow let's,6339.78,4.5
search for shadow,6342.0,4.46
thank you,6344.28,2.18
Shadow SM let's just grab that,6348.0,5.1
I'm just going to come in here and I'm,6351.3,4.02
going to add Shadow SM,6353.1,4.079
Ile so now you see a nice shadow below,6355.32,3.0
the nav bar,6357.179,3.121
let me reload that,6358.32,4.44
okay that's nice now the nav bar doesn't,6360.3,4.859
stay stuck the nav bar you can see it,6362.76,5.16
moves away so I'm just gonna add,6365.159,6.201
something called fixed top,6367.92,3.44
but now the trouble is that this,6373.739,5.161
information shifts up and also it looks,6375.9,5.04
like it's showing up behind the nav bar,6378.9,4.02
so I'll also give it a background,6380.94,4.14
so BG white I'm going to give a solid,6382.92,4.38
white background to the nav bar,6385.08,4.98
and now you can see here that content,6387.3,5.46
goes behind the nav bar all right not,6390.06,5.94
bad but I can't see the title here so to,6392.76,5.939
fix that we can just come in here into,6396.0,5.28
the nav and right below the nav because,6398.699,5.341
it is fixed it is kind of popping out of,6401.28,4.439
the page so that's why it doesn't have,6404.04,3.9
anything behind it so we can just put a,6405.719,4.98
div and let's give it a height let's,6407.94,4.32
look up the navbar height,6410.699,4.081
I believe it should be about,6412.26,5.939
56 pixels so let's go into this this is,6414.78,5.879
a nav bar you can see the height 40 plus,6418.199,5.221
8 plus 856 so the nav bar is kind of,6420.659,4.741
popping out of the page but we need to,6423.42,4.259
put an element behind it at the top of,6425.4,5.04
the page to compensate for it popping,6427.679,5.701
out so I'm just going to put height 56,6430.44,5.1
pixels and now you can see that suddenly,6433.38,5.279
this is now showing up below because of,6435.54,5.94
this display great looking nice let's,6438.659,4.921
add a footer as well let me go back into,6441.48,5.639
these examples here let me check footer,6443.58,6.32
yeah there it is photos let's open up,6447.119,6.361
index.html let me grab maybe this footer,6449.9,6.04
this footer looks nice so this is footer,6453.48,4.56
number three so I'm just going to open,6455.94,5.299
this up in vs code,6458.04,6.24
and photo number three so that's photo,6461.239,4.361
number one,6464.28,2.7
foot number,6465.6,5.119
two foot number three,6466.98,3.739
I think this is it,6470.94,5.46
go back create a file,6472.98,6.42
footer.html,6476.4,3.0
paste that in here that's our footer I,6481.44,4.92
think here it says Company Incorporated,6484.44,4.02
let me just change that to Jovian,6486.36,4.319
and there are a bunch of links here,6488.46,4.14
which don't point to anything yet but we,6490.679,4.261
can fix that later and let me just go,6492.6,4.92
into home and here at the bottom,6494.94,6.739
somewhere let's add,6497.52,4.159
footer,6502.139,2.901
and there you go now you see here,6505.8,4.8
copyright 2022 I think maybe I didn't,6507.9,4.62
copy the whole thing there may be,6510.6,3.24
something we need to change here maybe,6512.52,3.179
let me try this one,6513.84,4.76
I think this is the one,6515.699,2.901
yeah there we go now we have this nice,6523.86,3.259
Footers now we can go back into,6525.719,4.681
home.html and we can get rid of this,6527.119,6.221
copyright 2022 part here,6530.4,4.08
great,6533.34,2.399
so,6534.48,4.5
all good so far we have a footer and,6535.739,5.341
then we have a nav bar this image here,6538.98,4.86
it's it feels a little weird because,6541.08,4.32
it's cut off on the left and right so,6543.84,3.26
let me come back here and let me go into,6545.4,4.92
home.html let me take this image and let,6547.1,5.2
me move it out of the container so I'm,6550.32,3.54
just going to move this image out and,6552.3,3.48
this happens all the time where when you,6553.86,4.379
see something implemented it doesn't,6555.78,4.68
seem as nice and you may want to just,6558.239,4.44
change it so let me move that out and,6560.46,5.58
let me get rid of this about Joven and,6562.679,6.801
let's see what happens now,6566.04,3.44
this is much nicer so now we have the,6569.58,4.139
snap bar now we have this image that,6572.1,3.66
goes under it of course we may want some,6573.719,5.581
padding below it so we may say margin,6575.76,5.04
bottom,6579.3,6.08
16 pixels and there we go,6580.8,4.58
okay so this is nice but I would like to,6586.44,3.36
have maybe an image here on the right,6588.36,4.259
just to Showcase how nice it is to work,6589.8,4.26
at jobin so I'm going to go back to,6592.619,4.02
onesplash.com,6594.06,4.559
and let me just search for people,6596.639,3.06
working,6598.619,3.901
so obviously these will not be Joven,6599.699,5.161
employees but let's get them in here,6602.52,4.92
let's just call this people and let's go,6604.86,5.22
back into templates let us go into,6607.44,3.66
static,6610.08,3.78
add that in there and let me add this,6611.1,5.24
image here,6613.86,2.48
lead I'm going to put a div around it,6616.92,5.64
and put a div around that,6619.619,5.401
I am going to add the image here below,6622.56,5.88
this IMG SRC equals,6625.02,5.58
static,6628.44,5.16
slash people.jpeg,6630.6,7.079
and let's set a height for it,6633.6,5.34
height,6637.679,4.261
320px,6638.94,3.0
now here I'm going to apply a,6642.3,5.339
class row and then here I'm going to,6645.239,4.321
apply,6647.639,4.681
call six,6649.56,4.5
and then here I'm going to apply call 6,6652.32,4.22
as well,6654.06,2.48
let's see what that does,6662.76,4.859
so now we have this nice image on the,6665.4,4.92
left I can even give this a nice border,6667.619,4.08
so,6670.32,3.12
let me say,6671.699,3.54
border,6673.44,4.799
radius 4px,6675.239,5.521
and now we have a nice border here,6678.239,5.46
I think we may want to give some,6680.76,5.76
margin below the image so,6683.699,6.181
style equals margin bottom,6686.52,5.639
16px,6689.88,4.319
okay that's nice now this is looking,6692.159,6.0
nice on desktop but I think on mobile we,6694.199,6.42
probably may not want this image it's a,6698.159,4.98
little messy so what you can do is you,6700.619,4.381
can do a couple of things you can say,6703.139,5.161
you want this to be six,6705.0,6.239
only on medium devices and bigger so,6708.3,5.46
that's where you can say call md6 and,6711.239,5.101
here you can say that you want this to,6713.76,8.04
not be displayed d none and DMD,6716.34,7.56
block so basically you don't want it to,6721.8,4.2
be displayed on mobile and you want it,6723.9,4.02
to be displayed only on medium screen so,6726.0,4.08
now you can see Jovian careers here,6727.92,4.92
is just showing the text and not showing,6730.08,6.26
the image and showing open positions,6732.84,3.5
and here jobin careers is also showing,6736.38,5.6
the image,6739.679,4.681
but the apply buttons don't quite work,6741.98,4.78
right now and unfortunately they cannot,6744.36,4.02
work right now because we have not,6746.76,4.2
implemented the second page but we can,6748.38,4.5
do a quick trick here so what we can do,6750.96,3.6
is clicking on the apply button can,6752.88,4.56
actually just open an email address to,6754.56,5.7
somebody from the Joven team and maybe,6757.44,4.08
the email can already have a,6760.26,4.56
pre-populated subject so here instead of,6761.52,5.82
using a button we can change this to an,6764.82,5.46
anchor tag so that's again something you,6767.34,6.06
will learn when you look at HTML in a,6770.28,5.339
little more detail so now we've not made,6773.4,4.44
any change yet but now we can do this we,6775.619,4.441
can point this to some URL so let me,6777.84,3.839
just point this to google.com to show,6780.06,3.8
you,6781.679,2.181
and now when I click on this it's going,6786.48,5.28
to open google.com you see so the a tag,6788.52,6.719
is used to create links in HTML and the,6791.76,5.16
target of the link is simply specified,6795.239,4.44
using the href attribute of the a tag so,6796.92,4.08
you are probably aware of links like,6799.679,3.781
https and HTTP that open in the browser,6801.0,3.84
but there's a special type of Link,6803.46,3.659
called mail2,6804.84,5.1
so if you search for mail to links what,6807.119,4.801
they do is they open your email program,6809.94,5.04
so you can actually do this mail to this,6811.92,4.86
and you can also in fact include a,6814.98,3.84
subject here and you can in fact not,6816.78,3.6
only include a subject you can include a,6818.82,3.839
body and a lot of other things so let me,6820.38,5.96
just do this mail to,6822.659,5.341
AI,6826.34,5.14
question mark subject equals,6828.0,5.88
application,6831.48,4.38
for,6833.88,4.259
and let me get the job name here,6835.86,3.839
so job,6838.139,3.121
title,6839.699,4.681
let me just do that and now when I click,6841.26,5.1
on this link,6844.38,3.48
it's going to now open a mail,6846.36,3.48
application and it's going to type this,6847.86,3.9
mail to hello Joe Windows AI application,6849.84,3.839
for data analyst and it's going to be,6851.76,3.84
sent from your email and whatever mail,6853.679,3.421
application you have configured on your,6855.6,4.2
phone or on your desktop or whatever so,6857.1,5.639
if I go in here there is a,6859.8,6.54
tool here called mail2link dot me and if,6862.739,6.721
I just change this to hello at jovian.ai,6866.34,10.799
and application for XXX and body my name,6869.46,9.659
and here you can just ask the person to,6877.139,3.721
put the name,6879.119,4.321
and my,6880.86,4.56
resume link,6883.44,3.779
resume link,6885.42,6.42
and my LinkedIn link,6887.219,7.561
LinkedIn link so here we can go and,6891.84,5.22
construct a mail to URL so I'm just,6894.78,4.5
going to copy this mail to URL I'm going,6897.06,4.02
to come back here I'm going to paste,6899.28,4.68
this mail to URL here,6901.08,6.059
in the href,6903.96,5.94
okay and all I'm going to change here is,6907.139,5.761
application for instead of XXX I'm going,6909.9,5.16
to change this to,6912.9,5.1
application for job,6915.06,4.86
title,6918.0,5.239
and now let's try that,6919.92,3.319
and now it opens mail and you can see,6924.06,5.28
here that it has created a sort of form,6927.0,5.1
that somebody who wants to apply can,6929.34,5.58
simply fill out and send the mail and we,6932.1,4.079
will get an email,6934.92,2.94
and we can do the same thing for contact,6936.179,4.381
so let's go into contact as well let's,6937.86,5.299
construct,6940.56,2.599
question about job openings,6944.94,4.219
and let's just put,6949.679,3.261
my question,6952.98,2.84
enter question here and let's just copy,6957.06,4.88
that,6959.699,2.241
and I'm going to go back into the code,6962.159,4.98
into home I'm going to go into the,6964.56,4.559
contact button change that from a button,6967.139,4.621
to link all that we need to change is,6969.119,4.261
just change the tag,6971.76,5.34
and we type href equals such and such,6973.38,6.18
and now our contact button is going to,6977.1,5.18
work as well,6979.56,2.72
so there you go my name my question and,6982.5,5.34
that's it so now we have a fully working,6985.739,4.321
site now we can of course fix these,6987.84,4.68
links as well so we can go in here into,6990.06,4.679
our footer.html,6992.52,3.84
and we can fix the links that we're,6994.739,6.081
looking at so home we can point to,6996.36,6.42
jovian.ai,7000.82,5.879
and let me change this to courses,7002.78,3.919
and let's change that to,7007.4,4.799
show windowed AI slash learn,7010.04,5.96
let's change,7012.199,3.801
let's call this events,7016.46,7.08
and let's send that to jiovin.ai slash,7019.219,6.96
events and by the way if you want a link,7023.54,4.619
to open on a new tab you provide a,7026.179,5.04
Target attribute underscore blank and,7028.159,4.44
that's going to open it in a new tab,7031.219,4.801
again something that you can easily look,7032.599,5.881
up if you just search how to open a link,7036.02,3.78
in a new tab,7038.48,4.08
okay HTML is all about just constantly,7039.8,5.52
looking things up and let's fix this,7042.56,5.4
also to,7045.32,6.2
show Windows AI slash about,7047.96,3.56
and there you go so now we have almost a,7052.34,4.08
fully working site we can probably add a,7054.739,3.48
couple of links here the same links that,7056.42,4.08
are there in the footer but if I click,7058.219,4.44
on home it opens the job inside if I,7060.5,3.719
click on courses it opens the job in,7062.659,3.661
courses if I click on events it opens up,7064.219,3.181
events,7066.32,3.419
and contact us opens email,7067.4,6.66
apply opens email it mentions the name,7069.739,6.661
of the role that you're applying to so,7074.06,4.079
if I click on backend engineer you can,7076.4,4.799
see here it puts application for backend,7078.139,5.761
engineer if I put front-end engineer it,7081.199,4.561
puts application for front-end engineer,7083.9,4.56
and so on,7085.76,5.76
so there we just added mail to links and,7088.46,6.84
we've already been using proper files to,7091.52,5.46
organize our templates because now we,7095.3,3.899
can reuse footer nav and job item on,7096.98,4.139
other Pages as well and it's also just,7099.199,3.48
easier to read the code when it is in,7101.119,3.301
multiple files so we've done some,7102.679,3.181
refactoring as well,7104.42,3.48
so that's it we just created a,7105.86,4.5
functioning site let me just save this,7107.9,4.92
so let's just call this,7110.36,4.92
functional,7112.82,3.839
and,7115.28,2.939
aesthetic,7116.659,3.241
improvements,7118.219,3.841
and let's commit and push that and by,7119.9,4.08
the time we're done recapping it should,7122.06,5.22
be deployed so what did we do today we,7123.98,5.4
started out by setting up a project on,7127.28,4.2
GitHub we then opened up that project on,7129.38,4.44
triplet for development we then created,7131.48,4.679
and ran a flask web server by installing,7133.82,4.2
flask and creating a flask cap and,7136.159,4.801
registering a route we then push those,7138.02,4.619
changes back to GitHub,7140.96,4.62
then we learned how to create templates,7142.639,5.761
using the templates folder and in the,7145.58,5.28
templates folder we put an HTML file and,7148.4,4.38
then we rendered it using render,7150.86,4.98
template inside app.pi,7152.78,5.7
that's all we did and then we added HTML,7155.84,4.319
tags inside it,7158.48,4.32
to create the structure of the page and,7160.159,3.96
how did we come up with the structure of,7162.8,5.58
the page we created it on excalator.com,7164.119,5.941
so we created it using a simple,7168.38,3.42
wireframing tool you could do it on pen,7170.06,3.059
and paper as well,7171.8,3.54
and then we styled the page using CSS,7173.119,4.201
classes but of course our design skills,7175.34,3.48
are fairly limited so that's where we,7177.32,3.299
use the bootstrap framework for faster,7178.82,4.319
development and bootstrap simply offers,7180.619,5.941
a whole bunch of helper classes and,7183.139,6.54
utilities and even example code to,7186.56,4.86
create the kind of layouts that you want,7189.679,3.361
to create,7191.42,4.98
then we saw how to render Dynamic data,7193.04,6.42
using the templating syntax we took some,7196.4,4.92
information about jobs from a list of,7199.46,4.259
dictionaries and we rendered it,7201.32,6.0
using a for Loop in the home.html file,7203.719,5.821
we also learned how to organize our,7207.32,4.74
templates better using the include,7209.54,5.76
keyword so here we have job item dot,7212.06,8.22
HTML which is used inside home.html,7215.3,7.68
then we deployed that project to,7220.28,5.28
render.com you can see here we deployed,7222.98,5.219
it all the deployments are visible here,7225.56,5.52
looks like a deployment just went live,7228.199,4.801
and then finally we also connected a,7231.08,3.48
domain so you can buy a domain on,7233.0,3.96
google.com and all we had to do was put,7234.56,5.579
in a couple of DNS records and now on,7236.96,8.3
Jovian careers dot XYZ,7240.139,5.121
we have our careers website Jovian do,7245.36,5.22
something great show in careers I should,7248.84,3.359
probably replace this with some,7250.58,3.659
information about the company replace,7252.199,4.5
this with maybe an actual photo open,7254.239,4.261
positions so it would be nice if there,7256.699,3.301
was a form here and all and maybe we'll,7258.5,3.36
do that next time but right now it works,7260.0,3.9
I can actually share this website and,7261.86,4.02
people can click apply it'll send an,7263.9,4.5
email to hello jobin.ai and they can,7265.88,4.739
also contact us and they can use all of,7268.4,3.9
these links,7270.619,3.54
so we added the nav bar in footer we,7272.3,3.48
added a bunch of mail to Links we made,7274.159,3.301
the website mobile friendly you can,7275.78,3.48
actually right click inside your Chrome,7277.46,5.4
browser and pull these developer tools,7279.26,5.22
to the site and then click this mobile,7282.86,5.4
button and voila you're looking at your,7284.48,6.98
website on mobile,7288.26,3.2
so there you go on mobile this is what,7292.04,4.619
the website looks like,7293.96,5.219
not too bad it is usable maybe there is,7296.659,4.141
some spacing left and right that we can,7299.179,4.44
fix but largely it looks fine so I guess,7300.8,4.859
I can share this link over WhatsApp or,7303.619,3.48
wherever and people can start applying,7305.659,3.721
so in just a couple of hours from,7307.099,5.461
concept to execution to deployment to,7309.38,5.339
styling we've built a careers website,7312.56,3.9
for Jovian something that we actually,7314.719,3.241
plan to use now,7316.46,3.779
we did not go deep into any one area,7317.96,3.719
because this was sort of a walk through,7320.239,3.841
now what you should try and do is try to,7321.679,4.681
replicate this on your own maybe create,7324.08,5.099
a personal website and maybe list your,7326.36,5.759
projects there and also in that process,7329.179,5.101
you may want to then go deeper into some,7332.119,4.141
of these tutorials explore the HTML,7334.28,3.899
tutorial explore the CSS tutorial,7336.26,5.04
explore the bootstrap documentation the,7338.179,4.801
more time you spend with it the more you,7341.3,3.18
try things the better you're going to,7342.98,4.32
get at it and that's all that we have,7344.48,5.1
for today now what are some ways in,7347.3,4.02
which we can improve this we can create,7349.58,3.84
a page to show the details about the job,7351.32,3.899
for example requirements,7353.42,3.06
responsibilities,7355.219,1.92
Etc,7356.48,3.48
we can also add a form within the same,7357.139,4.56
detail space to submit an application,7359.96,4.739
instead of sending an email and then we,7361.699,4.5
can store the information about the jobs,7364.699,3.48
and the applications in a cloud database,7366.199,4.44
so that this is fetched not from some,7368.179,4.801
object or some python list but it is,7370.639,4.261
fetched from a database and that,7372.98,3.78
database can then be updated and then,7374.9,3.48
the data from that database can be,7376.76,2.7
downloaded so we can have information,7378.38,2.88
about all the applications in a single,7379.46,2.58
place,7381.26,2.52
and finally when somebody fills an,7382.04,3.3
application form we can also send an,7383.78,3.359
automated email confirmation to a,7385.34,4.14
candidate and to a jovian admin after,7387.139,4.261
the application and then we can also,7389.48,3.78
create a login interface now now that,7391.4,4.44
people can submit applications maybe we,7393.26,5.1
need an admin interface where we can log,7395.84,4.319
in and view the submitted applications,7398.36,4.739
maybe accept or reject applications and,7400.159,4.56
maybe we also create a login application,7403.099,4.02
for people to view the status of their,7404.719,3.541
job,7407.119,3.301
what you're looking at here,7408.26,6.02
is actually not too far from,7410.42,5.759
dsmlbootcamp.com,7414.28,3.7
and you can see this is exactly what,7416.179,4.44
we've slowly built upon with more,7417.98,4.56
functionality connecting a database,7420.619,4.921
connecting login and adding forms and,7422.54,5.639
such things but this is all there is to,7425.54,4.38
web development you just figure out what,7428.179,4.381
you need to build then you find the,7429.92,4.799
smallest possible implementation of it,7432.56,4.02
that you can ship as soon as possible,7434.719,3.661
ideally within a few hours or within a,7436.58,4.079
day or within a week you build it you,7438.38,4.2
ship it then you identify what you can,7440.659,4.5
improve and then you pick up each task,7442.58,4.38
and then you keep implementing it and,7445.159,4.741
shipping it and that's all we do as web,7446.96,4.44
Developers,7449.9,3.96
I hope you've learned enough to try and,7451.4,4.199
build your own website and you can dig,7453.86,4.799
deeper in the areas that you need to,7455.599,5.761
the topic for today is database driven,7458.659,4.861
web applications today we are building,7461.36,4.799
on top of the previous tutorial on web,7463.52,4.56
development with python where we explore,7466.159,3.601
the basics of web development with,7468.08,3.9
python and created a jovian careers,7469.76,3.959
website listing the job openings at,7471.98,4.98
Jovian this is what the output of the,7473.719,5.641
previous lesson looked like we have a,7476.96,4.259
header here with a company name and then,7479.36,3.839
we have a banner image then we have some,7481.219,4.02
information about the company an image,7483.199,4.381
showing some people working and then a,7485.239,4.321
list of open positions with each,7487.58,4.2
position containing the title the,7489.56,4.02
location and the salary for that,7491.78,3.899
position there is also an apply button,7493.58,4.32
for each position and clicking on apply,7495.679,5.221
opens up your default email client and,7497.9,4.44
asks you to fill out some information,7500.9,4.259
over email so that was a quick and easy,7502.34,5.94
way for us to collect applications over,7505.159,4.321
email,7508.28,3.72
then we also have this contact us button,7509.48,4.38
clicking on it again opens up the email,7512.0,3.96
and fills in a different subject and,7513.86,4.2
body depending on which of these buttons,7515.96,3.779
are clicked then we also have a footer,7518.06,4.44
here which links to the jobin home page,7519.739,6.0
courses events and other information so,7522.5,5.04
this was what we worked on the last time,7525.739,5.341
and we did this using the flask HTML,7527.54,5.34
framework we also learned how to use,7531.08,6.059
HTML and CSS to build out the page and,7532.88,6.06
we saw how to use the bootstrap,7537.139,4.321
framework to quickly build a good,7538.94,4.62
looking page we also saw how to deploy,7541.46,4.679
the website to the cloud using the,7543.56,5.22
platform render.com and attach a custom,7546.139,5.0
domain in this case it was,7548.78,4.68
jobiancareers.xyz so today we're going,7551.139,4.901
to build on top of this and we are going,7553.46,5.759
to incorporate databases which form the,7556.04,5.88
backbone of most modern web applications,7559.219,5.221
including Jovian so we will look at how,7561.92,4.92
to connect a flask web application to a,7564.44,5.699
MySQL Cloud database we we will then,7566.84,5.58
learn how to create Dynamic Pages by,7570.139,4.5
pulling information from the database we,7572.42,4.259
will also see how to add entries to the,7574.639,3.841
database using data from form,7576.679,4.141
submissions for examples applications,7578.48,5.46
made to a job will be stored back into,7580.82,5.46
the database and finally we will deploy,7583.94,4.259
a production ready database driven web,7586.28,4.02
application to the cloud,7588.199,3.9
now the prerequisites for today's,7590.3,5.64
tutorial are python flask HTML and CSS,7592.099,5.941
flask HTML CSS were covered in the,7595.94,3.659
previous tutorial so if you haven't seen,7598.04,4.079
that you should check that out but since,7599.599,3.721
we are going to be working with,7602.119,3.781
databases and relational databases in,7603.32,4.68
particular you will also need to know,7605.9,5.4
some amount of SQL or SQL just enough to,7608.0,5.46
create tables get data out of tables and,7611.3,4.2
put data into tables,7613.46,3.719
and here are the topics we're going to,7615.5,3.659
look at today we're going to look at,7617.179,4.081
Cloud databases using the planet scale,7619.159,4.801
platform we are going to use the SQL,7621.26,4.919
Alchemy library to connect with Cloud,7623.96,4.92
databases we are going to create HTML,7626.179,4.92
lists and forms so we're going to go,7628.88,4.44
deeper into using HTML to create,7631.099,4.921
interactive Rich web pages and we're,7633.32,4.14
going to see how to create Dynamic web,7636.02,3.0
pages and we'll also talk a little bit,7637.46,3.96
about how to prevent spam on forms that,7639.02,5.36
are published online,7641.42,2.96
so the first step is to set up the,7644.659,5.58
project and the cloud database now here,7647.119,5.04
is a project that we worked on the last,7650.239,4.201
time the starter project code it is,7652.159,5.301
available here on this URL github.com,7654.44,6.239
Akash NS slash Jovian careers website,7657.46,7.12
now we don't want to disturb this code,7660.679,5.52
since it's already used for the previous,7664.58,3.599
tutorial we want to create a new GitHub,7666.199,3.96
repository but we want to use this code,7668.179,5.04
as the starting point so for that let's,7670.159,6.301
first go to github.com github.com is the,7673.219,5.161
platform where developers around the,7676.46,4.679
world create and share projects in the,7678.38,4.859
form of git repositories so I'm going to,7681.139,4.02
go to github.com and I'm signed in here,7683.239,3.541
already and you may have to sign in if,7685.159,3.241
you haven't done that already and click,7686.78,3.899
on new and I am going to create a,7688.4,4.38
repository under my username and I'm,7690.679,3.781
going to call it,7692.78,4.26
Jovian,7694.46,6.42
careers website V2,7697.04,5.4
and I'm going to leave out the,7700.88,2.94
description here I'm going to make it,7702.44,3.719
public I am going to not initialize the,7703.82,3.96
repository this time I'm going to leave,7706.159,3.781
it blank so I'm not going to add a,7707.78,4.319
readme file I am not going to add git,7709.94,3.719
ignore and I'm not going to choose a,7712.099,3.54
license I am just going to create the,7713.659,3.661
repository so let me click create,7715.639,4.621
repository and now because we have not,7717.32,5.76
added any data or any files into the,7720.26,5.1
repository yet even while setting it up,7723.08,5.22
we can now incorporate the changes from,7725.36,5.04
an existing repository into this,7728.3,4.02
repository so there are many ways to do,7730.4,4.38
this but I am interested in The Last One,7732.32,5.22
Import code from another repository so,7734.78,4.919
I've just created a new project jobin,7737.54,4.98
careers website V2 and I'm going to take,7739.699,5.701
the URL of the GitHub repository which,7742.52,5.52
contains the code that we completed in,7745.4,4.199
the previous tutorial,7748.04,4.32
and I'm going to click import code and,7749.599,5.161
I'm going to enter the URL of the old,7752.36,3.72
Repository,7754.76,4.979
and now GitHub is going to pull all the,7756.08,5.88
code from the old repository Jovian,7759.739,4.081
Courier's website into the new,7761.96,4.62
repository Jovian careers website V2 so,7763.82,5.04
now we have created a new repository,7766.58,4.619
with an exact copy of an older,7768.86,4.379
repository and you can do this for any,7771.199,3.9
public repository that you find on the,7773.239,4.021
internet you can copy its URL and you,7775.099,5.701
can pull that code into your own git,7777.26,5.82
repository using the import function,7780.8,4.319
let's give that a second to run and,7783.08,3.48
while that is running let's talk about,7785.119,4.62
what we are going to look at today,7786.56,5.76
so first we are going to copy the GitHub,7789.739,4.081
project we are going to once again open,7792.32,4.08
it up on replit and deploy it to render,7793.82,4.319
then we are going to set up a cloud,7796.4,4.14
mySQL database on a platform called,7798.139,4.02
Planet scale then we're going to create,7800.54,4.139
a table a jobs table and add data to it,7802.159,4.98
using the MySQL workbench and don't,7804.679,4.081
worry these terms make don't make sense,7807.139,3.6
we are going to cover those and finally,7808.76,3.72
we are going to connect to the database,7810.739,4.621
from our GitHub from our project within,7812.48,5.88
replit using the SQL Alchemy Library,7815.36,5.04
then we are going to create some,7818.36,4.379
database driven Dynamic pages to display,7820.4,4.62
the list of jobs that are present in the,7822.739,4.141
cloud database then we are going to,7825.02,4.079
improve the layout styling and,7826.88,5.04
navigation of the pages using bootstrap,7829.099,4.321
and finally we're going to push the,7831.92,3.42
updated code to GitHub and deploy it,7833.42,4.319
again with the dynamic pages,7835.34,4.259
next we're going to look at how to store,7837.739,3.601
the submitted applications in the,7839.599,4.381
database and finally we are going to,7841.34,4.2
make some functional and aesthetic,7843.98,5.119
improvements to our application,7845.54,3.559
all right well this doesn't seem to be,7851.36,4.5
working at the moment and this happens,7853.82,4.14
sometimes this particular functionality,7855.86,5.22
on GitHub could be down so we're going,7857.96,5.34
to try an alternative because the,7861.08,6.139
automated import is not exact working,7863.3,3.919
so we're going to follow a different,7872.659,4.261
approach here since the import did not,7874.4,3.9
work,7876.92,3.42
so I've just downloaded the original,7878.3,4.68
code here from Joven Courier's website,7880.34,4.319
as a zip file,7882.98,4.32
and I have opened up that zip file on my,7884.659,4.741
desktop so now you can see this folder,7887.3,3.96
Joven Courier's website Main,7889.4,4.62
I'm going to change its name to Jovian,7891.26,5.66
Courier's website,7894.02,2.9
V2,7898.88,3.779
and then let's enter Joven Courier's,7900.679,4.321
website V2,7902.659,5.401
and now we can follow the instructions,7905.0,6.0
here to create a new repository so first,7908.06,4.8
I'm going to initialize a new repository,7911.0,4.619
using git init and now a new repository,7912.86,4.799
has been initialized then I'm going to,7915.619,3.781
add everything that is present here,7917.659,4.801
using get add Dot,7919.4,6.36
then I am going to commit,7922.46,8.42
git commit minus M initial commit,7925.76,5.12
and then finally I am going to add a,7931.159,3.781
remote here so I'm going to do git,7933.199,5.121
remote add origin,7934.94,3.38
and I have added this origin here,7939.8,7.04
and then I'm going to push,7943.639,3.201
and now this is pushed,7952.3,5.08
okay so this is the other approach what,7954.739,4.561
we try to do here was we try to click,7957.38,4.44
import and after clicking import we,7959.3,6.12
simply put in the URL but that sometimes,7961.82,6.24
it works sometimes it doesn't so what we,7965.42,4.199
did instead was we went to the original,7968.06,4.559
Repository and we downloaded a zip file,7969.619,4.98
and then we opened up the zip file and,7972.619,3.54
we followed the instructions to push,7974.599,3.781
this code to the careers website V2,7976.159,4.98
repository okay don't worry about the,7978.38,4.319
specifics here generally the import,7981.139,3.661
command should work for you in this case,7982.699,4.801
it just did not unfortunately now we,7984.8,5.7
have Joven Courier's website V2 and this,7987.5,4.679
contains all the code that we had,7990.5,3.96
created the last time the main code was,7992.179,5.221
in app.pi where we created a flask,7994.46,5.639
application and then we had a list of,7997.4,5.58
jobs and then we had a route here which,8000.099,5.361
rendered on the home page the,8002.98,5.34
templatehome.html with the data jobs and,8005.46,4.9
the company name Joven and what was the,8008.32,4.74
home.html template well we can see here,8010.36,5.46
inside templates and inside home.html,8013.06,5.519
that this contained some downloading or,8015.82,4.62
including the bootstrap framework and,8018.579,3.781
then it contained some other layouts,8020.44,3.779
like the navigation bar and then the,8022.36,4.08
Jovian careers title and then some,8024.219,4.621
information and followed by some list of,8026.44,5.1
jobs which is exactly what we see Joven,8028.84,3.839
careers,8031.54,5.099
dot XYZ all right so we have exactly the,8032.679,5.761
code that we ended up with the last time,8036.639,4.5
now we want to open up this code on the,8038.44,5.34
platform replit so replit is the,8041.139,5.94
platform for developing code online and,8043.78,5.819
we can now import this new repository,8047.079,5.1
into replit by logging into replit and,8049.599,3.961
then either you might have to connect,8052.179,3.0
your GitHub if you're not if you haven't,8053.56,3.599
already connected it or if you've,8055.179,4.141
connected it then you may be able to,8057.159,4.44
access it directly depending on the,8059.32,4.02
permission you've given I've only given,8061.599,3.48
it permission to specific repositories,8063.34,3.359
so I'm going to click on see all your,8065.079,3.721
repos,8066.699,5.101
and now here I am going to try and find,8068.8,5.58
the repository here but I have only,8071.8,4.379
currently given replied permission to,8074.38,4.859
access one repository so I wanted to,8076.179,6.54
access another repository as well so let,8079.239,4.681
me just,8082.719,3.541
click on see all your repos here and,8083.92,4.56
click this button here manage the git,8086.26,4.5
repos GitHub repositories replit can,8088.48,4.5
import so let's click on manage the git,8090.76,4.56
repositories replit can import,8092.98,6.0
now here we can then click configure to,8095.32,5.759
configure which repositories replit can,8098.98,4.5
import and I'm going to scroll down here,8101.079,4.381
and looks like currently it only has,8103.48,5.04
access to the Jovian careers website but,8105.46,4.92
I'm going to click this drop down and,8108.52,4.199
search for Jovian,8110.38,5.04
careers website V2,8112.719,5.96
and I'm going to click save,8115.42,3.259
and now,8119.139,3.421
all we have done is we have upgraded,8120.579,3.66
replitz permission,8122.56,4.44
from just accessing one repository to,8124.239,5.581
now accessing two repositories okay and,8127.0,3.659
now,8129.82,3.299
we can click akashina slash Jovian,8130.659,5.161
couriers website V2 and now we can,8133.119,5.1
import this from GitHub and create a new,8135.82,3.96
replit project,8138.219,2.94
so now,8139.78,4.319
the replit project is created using,8141.159,5.821
jobin careers website V2 the repository,8144.099,4.681
and we can make changes here and push,8146.98,5.06
them back to GitHub,8148.78,3.26
now the good part here is because we are,8156.639,3.781
starting from an existing project,8159.159,3.601
everything is set up for us already so,8160.42,3.84
we don't need to do a lot of setup you,8162.76,3.419
can see we have a DOT triplet file which,8164.26,3.6
has the language and the Run command,8166.179,4.261
already set up for us and if I enable,8167.86,3.9
hidden files here you will be able to,8170.44,3.659
see the config file you can see we have,8171.76,4.68
our requirements.txt and some other,8174.099,4.02
files containing the list of libraries,8176.44,3.48
required,8178.119,4.741
of course we have the app itself and now,8179.92,6.179
if we click run we should now have in,8182.86,5.4
our development mode the exact same site,8186.099,4.08
that we had completed in the last,8188.26,4.259
tutorial so let's give that a second to,8190.179,6.781
run but we have now been able to,8192.519,6.601
copy the GitHub project and open it up,8196.96,3.42
on triplet,8199.12,3.12
now another thing we can do is we can,8200.38,4.2
take this project and deploy it to,8202.24,3.54
render.com,8204.58,4.26
so let's go to render.com now I'm going,8205.78,5.699
to open render.com which is the platform,8208.84,4.44
where we perform the deployment the last,8211.479,7.341
time and let's go into the dashboard,8213.28,5.54
and now in the dashboard this is my old,8220.899,4.141
careers website so now I'm going to,8223.359,3.481
click new I'm going to select web,8225.04,2.939
service,8226.84,3.839
and once again I have only given it,8227.979,3.901
permission to access certain,8230.679,4.081
repositories on GitHub so here I might,8231.88,4.62
once again want to configure the GitHub,8234.76,4.02
access for render.com so I'll click,8236.5,3.719
configure account,8238.78,3.659
I will go into the configuration here,8240.219,5.46
and give it access to the other,8242.439,6.12
repository which is,8245.679,4.561
Jovian,8248.559,6.741
careers website V2 and click save,8250.24,5.06
and now I should be able to access Joven,8255.76,4.86
Courier's website V2 so let me connect,8258.28,4.14
it with this new render project that I'm,8260.62,3.239
creating,8262.42,4.259
and let's call it,8263.859,4.5
Jovian,8266.679,5.641
careers website V2,8268.359,7.32
and all of this should largely be fine I,8272.32,5.52
can probably make it southeast Asia so,8275.679,4.201
that things load a little faster,8277.84,4.2
the branch main is fine the PIP install,8279.88,4.5
requirements for txt is fine I may just,8282.04,5.22
need to do gu Nikon,8284.38,6.36
app colon app so remember G unicorn is,8287.26,5.879
used to run a flask application in,8290.74,4.199
production and we have to give it the,8293.139,4.021
name of the file which is app without,8294.939,3.96
the dot pi and we have to give it the,8297.16,3.239
name of the flask application the,8298.899,2.881
variable which contains the flask,8300.399,3.54
application which is also app,8301.78,5.159
and I'm going to select the startup plan,8303.939,4.561
but you can also deploy it on free,8306.939,5.46
starter will just deploy a little faster,8308.5,7.46
and let's create that web service,8312.399,3.561
so now this is going to take the code,8316.96,3.96
from,8319.24,3.659
the same GitHub repository that we have,8320.92,4.259
just created and it is going to create a,8322.899,4.021
deployment that is going to be visible,8325.179,4.68
at this location Joven careers website,8326.92,5.46
v2.onrender.com,8329.859,5.881
however I want to put it on a domain so,8332.38,5.4
I am going to go into settings once,8335.74,4.979
again and under settings I am going to,8337.78,5.52
put in a custom domain,8340.719,4.38
so this is something that we did the,8343.3,2.879
last time as well so we're just,8345.099,3.361
repeating it right now so this time I'm,8346.179,4.68
going to put it on jovincareers.com so,8348.46,3.32
I've bought a new domain,8350.859,2.941
jovincareers.com I'm going to put it,8351.78,3.159
there,8353.8,4.46
and now,8354.939,3.321
because,8358.3,3.9
jovincareers.com is hosted on Google,8360.0,4.78
domains we need to configure jobin,8362.2,5.58
careers.com and point it to this render,8364.78,5.34
site jovencareers website v2.on,8367.78,4.76
render.com so let's go to,8370.12,4.62
domains.google.com that's where I have,8372.54,5.28
registered my domain,8374.74,3.08
so now here I am on my domains on Google,8379.599,6.601
Dot domains.google.com and let me click,8382.359,5.16
manage,8386.2,4.38
and now here I am going to go into the,8387.519,5.161
DNS settings so,8390.58,4.8
this is simply what you have to do to,8392.68,6.12
connect any website with a custom domain,8395.38,5.76
so let's,8398.8,4.5
copy this information so it looks like,8401.14,5.88
for jovencareers.com we need to add an a,8403.3,5.94
name or Alias record,8407.02,4.5
so here I'm going to see manage custom,8409.24,5.22
records I am going to scroll down and,8411.52,4.68
click create a new record,8414.46,4.8
and this is already set to jobin,8416.2,4.68
careers.com so we don't need to put,8419.26,2.88
anything here,8420.88,3.78
there are no Alias records here so,8422.14,5.4
another option is to put an a record so,8424.66,5.4
now let's copy this value and let's,8427.54,4.74
create an a record and let's put this,8430.06,3.78
value in here,8432.28,3.86
then we also want to point,8433.84,4.5
www.jobin careers.com to the same,8436.14,3.16
location,8438.34,4.62
so I am going to this time create a,8439.3,5.76
cname record so let's,8442.96,6.0
select C name let's put www here and,8445.06,6.0
let's put this in here and let's save,8448.96,4.26
that,8451.06,3.66
and let's come back here and click,8453.22,3.66
verify so it's going to take a moment it,8454.72,5.78
is going to try to verify the domain,8456.88,3.62
and that might take maybe a minute or,8464.979,4.5
two to completely get verified so we can,8466.84,5.58
wait for it to get verified but okay,8469.479,4.621
looks like it is verified and in a,8472.42,3.0
minute or two it should also have a,8474.1,3.0
certificate so it should load properly,8475.42,4.5
so now we can actually go on Joven,8477.1,4.219
couriers website,8479.92,3.96
v2.onrender.com to access the same site,8481.319,5.08
that we already had or we could also go,8483.88,4.439
to jovencareers.com,8486.399,3.841
and we will be able to access the same,8488.319,3.481
site okay,8490.24,3.9
so once you have set up this process,8491.8,4.2
then creating a new site is actually,8494.14,5.1
very fast very quick and now we finally,8496.0,4.74
completed the first step which is to,8499.24,3.3
copy the GitHub project open it up on,8500.74,4.199
replit and deploy to render,8502.54,5.52
now the second step is to set up a cloud,8504.939,5.761
mySQL database so this is where I'm,8508.06,4.919
going to show you one way to set up a,8510.7,4.02
cloud mySQL database but there are many,8512.979,3.601
online providers that help you create,8514.72,4.139
databases the one we are going to use,8516.58,6.06
today is called planetscale.com,8518.859,3.781
so planetscale.com is a fairly developer,8522.76,4.32
friendly database and we are going to,8525.52,3.12
use it because,8527.08,3.66
it has a free plan,8528.64,4.92
which gives you a fair amount of usage,8530.74,5.579
so you can store up to 5 GB and you can,8533.56,4.74
do up to 1 billion row rates per month,8536.319,4.561
so for personal projects you should be,8538.3,4.559
able to work with the free plan,8540.88,4.559
so you have to sign up here and I'm just,8542.859,5.241
going to sign in,8545.439,2.661
and once you're signed in you will be,8548.8,4.26
asked to create a database so I am going,8551.02,4.5
to go here go down here let's zoom in a,8553.06,3.9
little bit,8555.52,3.48
and I'm going to click create,8556.96,4.74
and let's call this database Jovian,8559.0,3.78
careers,8561.7,3.96
and let's put this close to us so let's,8562.78,4.56
put this in Mumbai,8565.66,4.319
and let's create database,8567.34,5.46
so now all we've done is we have signed,8569.979,6.721
up on planetscale.com and we have,8572.8,6.72
created a new database and now once it,8576.7,4.32
is initialized we will be able to,8579.52,3.299
connect to this database,8581.02,3.9
so first we will try to just connect it,8582.819,6.681
connect to it using the MySQL workbench,8584.92,4.58
so we have a database running somewhere,8589.6,4.74
in the cloud this is a mySQL database,8591.819,4.62
which is one type of relational database,8594.34,5.76
that can be accessed using SQL and MySQL,8596.439,6.96
workbench is a downloadable tool it is a,8600.1,5.04
tool that you can download on your,8603.399,4.621
computer to connect to this database,8605.14,6.12
right so you download MySQL workbench,8608.02,4.919
and using it you can connect to this,8611.26,3.78
database that is running on the cloud,8612.939,4.741
so let's download MySQL workbench you,8615.04,4.62
can click download now and then you can,8617.68,4.2
select the installation for your,8619.66,4.199
operating system in my case it is mac,8621.88,3.78
and I'm not going to download it because,8623.859,5.701
I already have it installed but now I,8625.66,5.279
can,8629.56,4.5
open up MySQL workbench you can see here,8630.939,6.301
this is what it looks like once it is,8634.06,6.48
installed MySQL workbench and I'm going,8637.24,6.239
to click the plus button here now when I,8640.54,5.04
click the plus button here I can set up,8643.479,4.441
a new connection so my Planet scale,8645.58,5.52
database is running somewhere on the,8647.92,6.66
cloud and let me call it Jovian,8651.1,7.28
careers Planet scale,8654.58,3.8
all right now I need some parameters to,8660.16,6.36
connect to this database in this case it,8663.819,5.241
looks like a certain host name is set,8666.52,5.1
127.0.0.1 that means my local computer I,8669.06,4.18
don't need that so I'm just going to go,8671.62,5.4
back here and I'm going to click connect,8673.24,6.36
and once you click connect,8677.02,5.4
now you will receive the parameters that,8679.6,5.4
you need to enter from your MySQL,8682.42,5.399
workbench and this is only shown once so,8685.0,4.2
you might want to just copy this,8687.819,3.421
information and,8689.2,4.44
paste it somewhere safe so I'm just,8691.24,4.86
going to put it here in this notepad but,8693.64,4.259
this is the information that we need to,8696.1,4.92
put into our MySQL workbench so let's go,8697.899,4.801
back to mySQL workbench so let's see,8701.02,3.9
what we need we need a host name so,8702.7,3.9
let's grab the hostname this is the,8704.92,4.8
hostname we need to provide,8706.6,5.219
then the port is something that is,8709.72,3.36
already configured we don't need to,8711.819,3.361
change anything here then we need a,8713.08,4.859
username so this is the username,8715.18,4.799
then we need a password so you can click,8717.939,4.261
store in Keychain so that the password,8719.979,4.621
gets saved so I'm going to copy this,8722.2,5.159
password and I am going to then paste it,8724.6,3.48
here,8727.359,3.361
and this should ideally get saved on my,8728.08,5.58
computer then we need a default database,8730.72,5.28
name which is called Joven career so I'm,8733.66,4.56
just going to do that as well and you,8736.0,3.899
can test the connection,8738.22,4.8
so when you type test connection it is,8739.899,4.801
going to try to connect and tell you if,8743.02,3.66
the configuration is correct,8744.7,4.32
and once the test connection is done we,8746.68,4.799
can click OK and now we can connect to,8749.02,5.339
this database from the MySQL workbench,8751.479,5.34
home so it should be listed here so this,8754.359,3.901
is something that you need to do the,8756.819,3.781
first time although you should keep hold,8758.26,4.139
on to that password you should not lose,8760.6,3.42
track of this password because this will,8762.399,4.201
not be shown once we close this,8764.02,5.04
window here okay,8766.6,5.339
all right so now we are connected to a,8769.06,4.799
database running on the cloud so let's,8771.939,4.561
just look at what databases are present,8773.859,5.401
in the server so if we do show databases,8776.5,5.1
you can see here it has a bunch of,8779.26,4.679
system databases like information schema,8781.6,4.56
MySQL sys and performance schema so this,8783.939,4.261
is all for internal use of MySQL we,8786.16,4.26
never touch these but there is this one,8788.2,4.68
new database called Jovian couriers so,8790.42,4.439
great now we have a new database Joven,8792.88,4.559
careers and let's see what's inside this,8794.859,4.861
database so first we say use,8797.439,5.401
Jovian careers,8799.72,5.94
and again this is basic SQL syntax so if,8802.84,5.099
you take any quick beginner tutorial on,8805.66,4.739
SQL you will learn this so now we are,8807.939,4.801
using the jobin careers database and now,8810.399,4.021
we can show the tables in this database,8812.74,5.36
by typing show tables,8814.42,3.68
and the casing doesn't matter but I just,8818.8,4.08
prefer using uppercase for any keywords,8820.66,4.5
so we've said show tables and currently,8822.88,4.8
there are no tables in the database so,8825.16,5.1
information in databases is organized,8827.68,5.28
into tables each table can represent one,8830.26,4.32
kind of entity for example you may have,8832.96,3.66
one table for jobs you may have one,8834.58,4.2
table for applications you may have one,8836.62,4.319
table for users and so on so think of,8838.78,4.86
tables like sheets in a spreadsheet,8840.939,5.221
workbook so each sheet represents a,8843.64,5.219
different kind of data all right so,8846.16,4.68
right now there are no tables so now we,8848.859,3.841
need to create some tables into our,8850.84,4.32
database so let's come back here we have,8852.7,4.92
set up a cloud mySQL database on planet,8855.16,5.279
scale and now we are going to create a,8857.62,5.4
table called jobs and add data to it,8860.439,4.861
using the MySQL workbench,8863.02,4.44
so here is how we create a table we say,8865.3,5.099
create table,8867.46,6.18
and then we give the name of the table,8870.399,6.301
and then we provide the list of columns,8873.64,5.28
in a table so table contains several,8876.7,4.619
rows and several columns so the columns,8878.92,4.439
have to be specified when we create the,8881.319,5.341
table so each job is going to have an ID,8883.359,4.921
so the First Column is going to be,8886.66,3.54
called ID and it is going to be an,8888.28,5.039
integer and I do not want the ID to be,8890.2,5.159
null so if you want to make something a,8893.319,3.961
required column then you say not null,8895.359,5.341
and additionally I am going to provide,8897.28,5.76
this additional argument called Auto,8900.7,3.54
increment,8903.04,3.72
so that I don't have to provide unique,8904.24,4.38
IDs so,8906.76,3.719
I don't have to think about entering an,8908.62,4.199
ID every time I try to insert a new row,8910.479,4.38
into the table a new ID will,8912.819,4.201
automatically be generated for me so,8914.859,3.601
that's why I'm putting in Auto increment,8917.02,4.32
here okay that's great then we have the,8918.46,5.16
job title which is some text so I'm just,8921.34,5.28
going to use where care so where care is,8923.62,5.1
the data type that is used to store text,8926.62,5.819
and the job title can be let's say 200,8928.72,5.82
250 characters so I'm going to just put,8932.439,4.981
in 250 here as the maximum length and we,8934.54,4.8
of course do not want the job title to,8937.42,5.04
be null or empty either,8939.34,5.639
then we have the job location which is,8942.46,4.979
also going to be a,8944.979,5.041
piece of text and that should also not,8947.439,3.661
be null,8950.02,3.299
in case the there is no location we can,8951.1,5.16
just put remote into it then there is a,8953.319,4.741
salary so it's possible that there may,8956.26,4.26
be some jobs where the salary is not,8958.06,5.64
specified so I'm going to use an INT,8960.52,5.94
here so salary of type int it is going,8963.7,5.699
to be an integer and it can be null so,8966.46,5.7
nothing more now we may have locations,8969.399,4.621
outside India as well we may have,8972.16,3.779
locations in multiple countries so we,8974.02,3.54
may want to keep track of the currency,8975.939,4.201
in which the salary will be paid so I'm,8977.56,4.08
just going to put in another column,8980.14,3.06
called currency which is going to be,8981.64,4.259
aware car and let's just put 10,8983.2,5.52
characters here not more and then,8985.899,5.161
finally with each job there are some,8988.72,4.44
responsibilities,8991.06,4.14
so I'm going to put in responsibilities,8993.16,5.279
here and let's also make that where care,8995.2,5.94
and this can be a large thing so I'm,8998.439,4.561
just going to give it the length 2000 so,9001.14,3.299
that you can put a whole bunch of,9003.0,3.24
information in here,9004.439,3.781
and then there are going to be some,9006.24,4.26
requirements some qualifications so I'm,9008.22,3.66
going to have another column called,9010.5,3.54
requirements let's also call that VAR,9011.88,4.34
care,9014.04,2.18
and that is the requirements column so,9017.28,6.6
far our table is looking good we have an,9021.06,5.04
ID title location salary currency,9023.88,4.74
responsibilities and requirements and,9026.1,4.799
one last thing I'm going to add here is,9028.62,4.02
the primary key,9030.899,4.08
and I'm going to make the ID the primary,9032.64,5.4
key which means that we are telling SQL,9034.979,5.221
that the ID should always be unique,9038.04,4.74
every row should have a unique ID and,9040.2,5.699
you can get data out of the table by,9042.78,5.159
providing a specific ID so I can say,9045.899,4.141
give me the information for the job with,9047.939,5.281
the id5 and that is what a primary key,9050.04,5.7
does all right so now we are ready to,9053.22,4.98
create the table so let's just click the,9055.74,4.32
lightning button here or we could also,9058.2,3.36
just press command enter or control,9060.06,3.419
enter and that should have created the,9061.56,4.379
table now so now if I go in into a new,9063.479,4.92
tab I've created a new tab here using,9065.939,5.281
command t or Ctrl t on Windows and now,9068.399,6.0
if I say short tables,9071.22,4.98
you can see that we have a table called,9074.399,3.0
jobs,9076.2,3.6
great and now if you want to look at,9077.399,4.201
information inside jobs we can say,9079.8,3.0
select,9081.6,5.04
star from jobs again this is basic SQL,9082.8,6.72
this is basic SQL that you will learn if,9086.64,5.219
you take any tutorial but if you do not,9089.52,4.08
want to type all these queries then you,9091.859,3.901
can also use the schemas tab here in the,9093.6,4.2
left sidebar and just refresh it once,9095.76,4.32
you can see under jobin careers you have,9097.8,4.44
tables and under tables you have jobs,9100.08,5.34
and you can just click this button here,9102.24,5.1
which is going to display the,9105.42,4.26
information inside the jobs table and it,9107.34,3.78
does the exact same thing by simply,9109.68,3.08
running select star from,9111.12,4.08
jovencareers.jobs all right so right now,9112.76,6.04
there is no data within the table now we,9115.2,5.699
can insert data into the table we can do,9118.8,4.32
this using an insert statement so we can,9120.899,4.92
do insert into,9123.12,4.38
jobs,9125.819,3.841
and while inserting we first have to,9127.5,4.319
provide a list of columns so if I go,9129.66,3.72
back here you can see that we have all,9131.819,3.181
these columns but out of all these,9133.38,3.12
columns only three columns are,9135.0,5.28
compulsory title and location,9136.5,7.38
and ID but the ID is going to be Auto,9140.28,5.64
generated using this Auto increment,9143.88,3.42
function so there's going to be a,9145.92,3.059
counter inside the table and it's going,9147.3,4.26
to Auto generate the ID for us so we,9148.979,4.261
only really need to provide the title,9151.56,3.24
and location those are the only two,9153.24,3.78
required fields to create a job so I'm,9154.8,3.66
going to say that we're going to provide,9157.02,4.2
the title and location and the values we,9158.46,4.74
want to put for title and location are,9161.22,4.8
data analyst,9163.2,4.5
and,9166.02,3.299
Bengaluru,9167.7,3.6
India,9169.319,3.721
so now we have written some code to,9171.3,4.139
insert some data into the database and,9173.04,5.0
let's run that,9175.439,2.601
and now you can see that here the insert,9181.92,4.5
statement executed successfully and it,9184.56,4.379
says one row was affected so if we now,9186.42,4.519
try select star from,9188.939,4.621
jovencareers.jobs then it is going to,9190.939,4.841
show us this information data analyst,9193.56,3.66
Bengaluru,9195.78,3.24
now this is one way to insert,9197.22,5.7
information into a SQL database from the,9199.02,6.6
MySQL workbench by executing a query but,9202.92,5.1
MySQL workbench also provides a nice,9205.62,4.62
user interface so we can type for,9208.02,4.02
example data scientist,9210.24,4.86
and I can type here New Delhi,9212.04,5.34
India,9215.1,4.74
and maybe I can put in some salary,9217.38,4.92
information as well so let me put in,9219.84,6.599
15 lakhs so zero zero zero zero zero and,9222.3,6.599
let me put in the currency rupees,9226.439,4.92
and after entering this information you,9228.899,4.141
can see an apply button here at the,9231.359,3.781
bottom of the table you can click apply,9233.04,4.38
and that is going to generate an insert,9235.14,3.96
statement for us so it's the exact same,9237.42,4.08
insert statement let me just zoom in,9239.1,4.759
here a little bit for you insert into,9241.5,4.38
jovencareers.jobs title location salary,9243.859,4.801
currency data scientist New Delhi India,9245.88,6.12
and so on and click apply and now that's,9248.66,5.8
going to execute this SQL query for you,9252.0,5.22
so MySQL workbench allows you to access,9254.46,5.46
and manipulate the database without,9257.22,5.099
having to write SQL queries as well and,9259.92,4.14
we can also update existing records so,9262.319,3.841
for example I could just do,9264.06,4.56
10 lakhs here,9266.16,4.8
and I could just put in rupees here as,9268.62,4.26
well,9270.96,4.56
and let's click apply and that's going,9272.88,5.7
to apply that for us okay,9275.52,5.04
great so one last thing I'm going to do,9278.58,3.779
is I'm going to grab a bunch of,9280.56,3.24
possibilities and requirements,9282.359,3.241
information for these jobs and put that,9283.8,4.44
in here as well so I have a link here to,9285.6,4.68
some sample jobs data,9288.24,4.079
so I'm just going to grab these sample,9290.28,4.199
responsibilities let me double click,9292.319,5.341
inside it copy it and come here double,9294.479,5.701
click inside and paste it,9297.66,4.56
and some sample requirements for the,9300.18,3.719
data analyst role let me double click,9302.22,5.58
copy here and paste it,9303.899,5.641
and similarly we have some sample,9307.8,3.9
require responsibilities for the data,9309.54,4.02
analyst for the data scientist role so I,9311.7,3.779
double click here and paste it,9313.56,3.54
and finally we have some sample,9315.479,3.481
requirements for the data scientists,9317.1,3.6
role so I'm going to bring that in here,9318.96,3.479
and I'm going to paste that in as well,9320.7,4.08
and I'm going to click apply,9322.439,4.201
and that's going to put all this,9324.78,4.44
information into the planet scale,9326.64,5.339
database okay so remember we are still,9329.22,4.62
connected to a database on the cloud so,9331.979,3.481
all this information is getting written,9333.84,4.019
into the database in the cloud,9335.46,6.479
great so now we have done the next step,9337.859,6.601
which is to create a jobs table and add,9341.939,5.221
data using the MySQL workbench,9344.46,5.7
so it's just step by step simple process,9347.16,5.52
of first creating a table using the,9350.16,4.44
create table statement and if you don't,9352.68,3.299
remember this you can always just look,9354.6,4.2
this up so create table SQL just search,9355.979,4.981
that online and maybe check out,9358.8,5.099
tutorials point and they have the syntax,9360.96,6.18
and then they have an example so this is,9363.899,4.5
not something that you have to remember,9367.14,3.12
or by heart the idea is you should be,9368.399,3.54
able to figure out how to create a table,9370.26,4.62
in a mySQL database okay so we created,9371.939,5.101
the table and then using the MySQL,9374.88,4.38
workbench we inserted some data into the,9377.04,5.34
table as well okay so now we can connect,9379.26,5.76
to this database from replit using SQL,9382.38,5.18
Alchemy,9385.02,2.54
so let's go back into replit here let me,9388.5,5.06
open up the rebel once again,9391.14,6.08
Courier's website V2,9393.56,3.66
so let's go back into replit and now,9397.26,5.04
inside replit I am going to create a new,9399.66,5.699
file here called database dot pi,9402.3,3.9
okay,9405.359,4.141
now in the database dot pi,9406.2,5.82
file I'm going to write some code to,9409.5,5.22
connect to the database and extract some,9412.02,4.919
data from the database and we are going,9414.72,4.62
to do this using the SQL Alchemy Library,9416.939,6.121
SQL Alchemy okay SQL Alchemy so you can,9419.34,5.72
also search this online SQL,9423.06,3.78
Alchemy,9425.06,4.72
it is a library you can see here that it,9426.84,6.0
is the database toolkit for Python and,9429.78,4.8
let's just search SQL Alchemy tutorial,9432.84,3.24
Maybe,9434.58,5.6
and here there seems to be,9436.08,4.1
let's see,9440.22,5.0
there is a tutorial,9441.96,3.26
yeah so there is a tutorial on tutorials,9448.14,4.44
point you can follow that and there is,9450.96,3.96
also an official tutorial so here you,9452.58,3.38
can see,9454.92,4.38
docs.sqlalchemy.org tutorial so you can,9455.96,5.019
check this out as well,9459.3,3.84
now to get started we need to First,9460.979,4.861
install SQL Alchemy and to install SQL,9463.14,4.44
Alchemy all we need to do as you might,9465.84,4.2
have guessed it already is come into the,9467.58,3.6
shell,9470.04,4.02
and inside the shell type pip install,9471.18,4.44
SQL,9474.06,4.4
Alchemy,9475.62,2.84
and that installs SQL Alchemy for us now,9478.5,5.399
once SQL Alchemy is installed we can,9481.439,5.101
import SQL Alchemy and we can check its,9483.899,4.561
version so I can come back here and I've,9486.54,3.54
imported SQL Alchemy and let me just,9488.46,4.5
print SQL Alchemy,9490.08,4.859
dot version,9492.96,4.08
I believe it's underscore underscore,9494.939,4.5
version underscore underscore and this,9497.04,3.96
can make this can help us ensure that,9499.439,3.241
SQL Alchemy is installed and we have the,9501.0,3.42
right version so let's come back here,9502.68,3.6
into the shell for a moment I'm going to,9504.42,3.36
close the browser,9506.28,4.199
and let's just reset the view here,9507.78,5.34
and let's type python,9510.479,5.941
database dot Pi so we are asking python,9513.12,5.58
to execute the code inside the file,9516.42,5.34
database dot pi and let's run that and,9518.7,4.64
now you can see here that it prints,9521.76,4.62
1.4.23 so looks like we have a valid,9523.34,5.68
version of SQL Alchemy installed,9526.38,6.3
next the next step is to establish the,9529.02,5.22
connectivity so I'm going to click the,9532.68,3.06
next section here and look at the code,9534.24,2.76
here,9535.74,3.78
so next it looks like we need to import,9537.0,6.78
from SQL Alchemy create engine and let's,9539.52,6.419
do that so from SQL Alchemy import,9543.78,3.96
create engine I am no longer going to,9545.939,3.301
print the version so I'm going to skip,9547.74,4.56
this as well and then we need to create,9549.24,5.4
an engine which is going to connect with,9552.3,5.04
the database okay the way we do this is,9554.64,5.16
we say engine equals create engine and,9557.34,4.8
here we provide information about how to,9559.8,4.8
connect to the database so all the,9562.14,3.78
information for connecting to the,9564.6,3.0
database remember all of this,9565.92,3.72
information all of this information has,9567.6,4.799
to be provided in a special format now,9569.64,5.58
the example given on this page talks,9572.399,5.941
about how to connect to sqlite which is,9575.22,6.48
a different type of database from MySQL,9578.34,5.94
which is what we are using so if we just,9581.7,5.58
search SQL Alchemy,9584.28,6.72
connect to mySQL,9587.28,7.199
and check the resources so again on the,9591.0,5.7
SQL Alchemy doc documentation website,9594.479,4.141
there is information about how to,9596.7,4.5
connect to mySQL as well,9598.62,5.279
and we can see here that the way to do,9601.2,5.779
it is using this using Create engine,9603.899,7.021
MySQL plus pi MySQL colon colon username,9606.979,7.301
colon password at Host slash database,9610.92,5.58
name okay so let's just copy that and,9614.28,4.32
let's put this in here so let's go here,9616.5,4.859
and let's do engine equals create engine,9618.6,6.66
MySQL plus pi MySQL what is the username,9621.359,5.701
well the username is something that we,9625.26,4.74
can get from here this is the username,9627.06,5.759
then we have a password so let's get the,9630.0,4.14
password Here,9632.819,3.841
and depending on which database provider,9634.14,4.02
you're using this information is going,9636.66,3.659
to be different so don't let all this,9638.16,4.319
scare you it's all simply just,9640.319,4.141
configuration to make sure that we can,9642.479,4.261
connect our code to the database that's,9644.46,5.22
all okay that was a password then we,9646.74,4.92
have the host so the third thing is the,9649.68,4.38
host so I'm going to grab the host here,9651.66,4.68
and I'm going to put the host,9654.06,4.32
information here and finally the,9656.34,3.72
database name we want to connect to and,9658.38,4.74
the database name is Joven couriers and,9660.06,5.64
let's check that let us now run this,9663.12,5.64
again so my python database dot Pi just,9665.7,6.779
to see the engine was created properly,9668.76,6.12
okay so now we get an error no module,9672.479,4.801
named Pi MySQL so looks like we need to,9674.88,5.16
install another Library so SQL Alchemy,9677.28,4.98
internally depending on which type of,9680.04,4.74
database you want to connect to requires,9682.26,5.82
some Library which can serve as a,9684.78,6.0
connector so I'm also going to install,9688.08,6.48
pip install ma Pi MySQL so because SQL,9690.78,5.46
Alchemy can connect to many different,9694.56,3.839
types of databases so it doesn't ship,9696.24,3.96
with all the built-in connectors you,9698.399,3.481
need to install a connector depending on,9700.2,3.119
which kind of database you are,9701.88,2.519
connecting to,9703.319,4.261
so I'm going to run pip install Pi MySQL,9704.399,6.241
and let us try to run python database.5,9707.58,5.779
once again,9710.64,2.719
it looks like this is running,9714.24,4.14
so great now looks like we are able to,9715.92,4.08
create an engine so we have given it,9718.38,3.66
some information and we have created an,9720.0,2.939
engine,9722.04,2.76
The Next Step would be to get some,9722.939,4.861
information out of the engine so this is,9724.8,6.179
how you can get some information out of,9727.8,5.639
the database by making a connection to,9730.979,4.441
the database using the engine so here's,9733.439,4.141
what you should do first it says we need,9735.42,4.92
to import text so from SQL Alchemy,9737.58,5.279
import text all right we've done that,9740.34,6.42
and then with engine.connect as con so,9742.859,5.101
this is just a way to set up a,9746.76,2.76
connection we are saying connect to the,9747.96,4.08
engine and give the connection a name,9749.52,4.68
con so then we can use that connection,9752.04,5.76
to execute commands onto that database,9754.2,5.76
and then anything we write inside the,9757.8,4.5
width can use this connection and once,9759.96,3.54
we come out of the width the connection,9762.3,3.24
will be automatically closed so that is,9763.5,3.72
the purpose of width you will see within,9765.54,3.24
a lot of places when we are connecting,9767.22,3.36
to databases or when we are working with,9768.78,4.44
files so what we do is we either open a,9770.58,4.2
file or connect to a database and then,9773.22,3.84
give that connection a name then we do,9774.78,4.32
some work with it and once we get out of,9777.06,3.78
the width the connection is closed,9779.1,4.92
automatically so let's grab this with,9780.84,5.16
engine.connect as con,9784.02,5.58
and then we can say result equals con,9786.0,6.42
dot execute and here we can give any SQL,9789.6,5.16
query okay in this case they've printed,9792.42,4.439
select hello world so they're not really,9794.76,4.26
querying the database but let me change,9796.859,5.221
this to select star from jobs we know,9799.02,4.98
that we our database has a table called,9802.08,4.56
jobs so let me just select start from,9804.0,5.64
jobs and then let us print what we get,9806.64,5.339
back so what we get back any database,9809.64,4.08
query that you make on SQL is going to,9811.979,3.361
give you a list of rows a table,9813.72,3.54
essentially of some sort right a list of,9815.34,4.46
rows of results so let's just print,9817.26,4.98
result.all which gives us all the rows,9819.8,4.96
of the result at once and let's try to,9822.24,6.0
run that now python database dot pi,9824.76,6.599
okay looks like there was an error and,9828.24,5.34
this is what is going to happen all the,9831.359,4.381
time whenever you are working on any,9833.58,4.5
project in Python 80 percent of the time,9835.74,3.96
the code you write is not going to work,9838.08,3.0
the first time there's going to be an,9839.7,3.42
error but that should not scare you you,9841.08,3.72
just have to read the error carefully,9843.12,4.26
and see what it says so let's see what,9844.8,5.7
it says now the way to understand python,9847.38,4.86
errors is to scroll all the way to the,9850.5,4.02
bottom and read what is given at the,9852.24,5.34
bottom so if we see carefully here it,9854.52,4.98
says there is an operational error so,9857.58,3.54
there was some error operationally,9859.5,4.14
internally inside SQL Alchemy and it,9861.12,5.52
says code unavailable server does not,9863.64,5.28
allow insecure connections the client,9866.64,6.48
must use SSL okay so there are some,9868.92,6.66
secure ways to connect to a database and,9873.12,3.96
there are some insecure ways so you may,9875.58,5.399
have heard of HTTP and https so all this,9877.08,5.52
is saying is that we need a slightly,9880.979,4.021
more secure way to connect to a database,9882.6,3.54
okay,9885.0,3.6
now we can explore how to do this first,9886.14,5.1
of all here we can go back into this,9888.6,6.06
connection MySQL and Maria DB and go,9891.24,6.92
down here and check how to connect,9894.66,3.5
securely so let's go back here and let's,9898.56,3.78
see maybe there is some information,9901.319,3.361
about how to connect using how to,9902.34,4.559
connect securely I'm going to search SSL,9904.68,3.96
and looks like there is some information,9906.899,3.241
here about,9908.64,3.42
SSL,9910.14,5.16
so here we are using pi MySQL that's the,9912.06,5.22
library we just installed and looks like,9915.3,4.679
for SSL connections it accepts the same,9917.28,5.699
arguments that mysqldb accepts as,9919.979,4.861
described in SSL connections so let's,9922.979,4.021
click that and this is something that,9924.84,3.84
you will often have to do when you are,9927.0,2.939
working with the library you will have,9928.68,3.299
to go into its documentation just try to,9929.939,3.601
understand what they're saying and try,9931.979,4.081
to figure out how to make things work,9933.54,4.98
okay so looks like if we want to connect,9936.06,4.74
securely we will have to pass something,9938.52,4.799
called connect arcs we will have to pass,9940.8,5.46
this into the create engine function and,9943.319,4.561
where inside connect tasks we will have,9946.26,3.24
to pass a dictionary with some,9947.88,4.439
information about SSL okay even I don't,9949.5,5.1
understand exactly what this is for or,9952.319,4.381
what this does but all I'm doing is,9954.6,4.32
interpreting the error here the error,9956.7,5.22
that I saw on replit searching for it in,9958.92,5.28
the documentation that inside I want to,9961.92,5.399
connect securely using SSL so there was,9964.2,5.279
some mention of SSL TLS here so I just,9967.319,3.721
searched that and I found some,9969.479,3.42
information here so so now I'm going to,9971.04,3.3
come back here and I'm going to make,9972.899,3.481
that change in my create engine function,9974.34,5.04
so now we have this,9976.38,4.2
so the first thing I'm going to do is,9979.38,3.059
maybe extract out this database string,9980.58,6.239
so let me just call it connection or DB,9982.439,6.661
connection,9986.819,4.981
string equals,9989.1,5.879
and let's put that into,9991.8,5.22
this,9994.979,5.101
so DB connection string so that's our,9997.02,6.54
first part but apart from this,10000.08,5.88
we also now need to pass this,10003.56,4.2
information which is connect args so,10005.96,4.08
let's build it step by step so connect,10007.76,5.82
args okay let's come back here let us,10010.04,5.939
put in Connect talks and connect args,10013.58,4.8
requires a dictionary so in this,10015.979,3.84
dictionary we are going to have a key,10018.38,6.08
called SSL so let's pass in SSL,10019.819,4.641
and now,10026.3,3.599
inside it there are these values that,10027.8,4.5
have to be provided I believe this is,10029.899,4.681
going to change depending on which,10032.3,4.08
database provider you're using so just,10034.58,3.6
like this has to change based on the,10036.38,3.479
database provider this also has to,10038.18,4.2
change based on the database provider so,10039.859,4.681
how about we go back into our database,10042.38,5.16
provider and here there is some,10044.54,4.319
information about how to connect with,10047.54,4.02
python so let's check that and looks,10048.859,3.661
like they've given some information,10051.56,3.12
about what to install they've given some,10052.52,4.2
information about like how to configure,10054.68,3.719
it so they are using something other,10056.72,3.719
than SQL Alchemy and here looks like,10058.399,3.54
they have given some information about,10060.439,4.741
the SSL certificate right so if you look,10061.939,6.54
here we have SSL and then inside SSL we,10065.18,5.4
have this sslca so let me just put that,10068.479,3.96
in here sslca,10070.58,5.76
and let's just paste it here sslca now,10072.439,5.761
instead of this value all I'm going to,10076.34,4.32
do is I'm going to get this value from,10078.2,4.86
planet scale okay so there seems to be,10080.66,5.04
some certificate that is required and,10083.06,4.32
the way you configure that certificate,10085.7,3.779
is by passing this value,10087.38,6.32
slash Etc SSL slash certificate.pe okay,10089.479,7.92
and I have just saved that and let's,10093.7,5.739
hope this works in a lot of cases you're,10097.399,5.781
just hoping and trying but let's see,10099.439,3.741
okay look like it worked so there were a,10104.78,6.24
few complications we ran into a few,10108.5,5.819
errors but ultimately we were able to,10111.02,5.52
figure out a connection string to,10114.319,4.921
connect to the planet scale database and,10116.54,4.14
then we were able to figure out how to,10119.24,3.54
connect securely and this is not,10120.68,3.06
something that you'll figure out,10122.78,2.52
immediately sometimes you may have to,10123.74,3.96
spend 20 30 minutes or sometimes you may,10125.3,5.599
have to just look online Planet scale,10127.7,5.76
SQL Alchemy,10130.899,5.46
how to connect,10133.46,2.899
and here it says that connect to any,10137.66,4.319
MySQL client to Planet scale using,10139.64,4.799
connection strings so there is some,10141.979,4.201
information available online generally,10144.439,3.42
speaking so you can see here that there,10146.18,2.82
is some information about connection,10147.859,3.601
strings and things like that or you can,10149.0,4.8
also go on stack overflow.com so you can,10151.46,7.32
always go on stack overflow.com and you,10153.8,6.84
can just post a question here and,10158.78,3.06
somebody will try and answer the,10160.64,3.54
question for you or you can ask us if,10161.84,3.72
you are part of the job in community,10164.18,4.98
right so developers I have to look up,10165.56,5.94
documentation developer developers have,10169.16,5.159
to try and figure things out by trial,10171.5,4.5
and error and try to look at the docs,10174.319,3.301
try to look at references try to look at,10176.0,3.66
blogs and figure it out and often they,10177.62,3.72
just have to ask each other to figure it,10179.66,3.96
out but this is what you had to do to,10181.34,4.44
connect to a planet scale database now,10183.62,4.5
connecting to a Google cloud or an AWS,10185.78,4.26
database may be slightly different but,10188.12,4.02
the important thing is we are able to,10190.04,4.5
get this data out so that's great now,10192.14,4.98
I'm curious what is the type of this,10194.54,4.26
object that is getting printed when we,10197.12,4.02
call result.all what is the type of the,10198.8,5.519
data that we get so first let me print,10201.14,5.7
type of result,10204.319,3.841
and then,10206.84,5.479
let's call this result all equals result,10208.16,7.86
dot all and let me print the,10212.319,8.861
type of result all and then let's also,10216.02,8.299
print result all itself,10221.18,3.139
and let's include some information here,10224.479,5.161
about what we are printing always a good,10227.12,3.779
idea otherwise you might get confused,10229.64,5.06
about what you are printing exactly,10230.899,3.801
so here we are checking the type of,10237.859,4.521
result.all,10239.479,2.901
and then finally here we are checking,10242.66,4.22
the,10245.06,4.32
result.all itself,10246.88,4.979
okay,10249.38,2.479
so this is what we are going to print,10252.5,4.2
just to get a better understanding of,10254.78,5.659
what this result is,10256.7,3.739
okay let's run python database.pi once,10265.1,3.36
again,10267.56,3.96
and looks like the result is of the type,10268.46,6.12
SQL Alchemy dot cursor but as soon as we,10271.52,5.94
call result.all we get back a list so,10274.58,5.04
you can see that the type of result.all,10277.46,4.92
is the class list so the result.all is,10279.62,4.8
actually a simple plain python list as,10282.38,3.96
soon as you do result at all it becomes,10284.42,5.22
a python list and then you have the,10286.34,4.86
result.all this is all the information,10289.64,3.66
that we obtained but let's check the,10291.2,4.739
type of the first element of result all,10293.3,5.46
so result or result all is a list so now,10295.939,5.641
we can say result all zero so just to,10298.76,4.8
look at the first element remember in,10301.58,4.739
Python elements are numbered from 0 in a,10303.56,4.44
list,10306.319,4.5
so result all 0 is simply this object,10308.0,4.859
and let's try to print the type of this,10310.819,4.201
result all zero so we are getting the,10312.859,4.08
first element out of the list that we,10315.02,4.02
obtained using result dot all which,10316.939,4.441
result was a cursor result.all is a list,10319.04,4.739
of results and let's now get the first,10321.38,4.439
element so let's just call it first,10323.779,4.341
result,10325.819,2.301
equals,10329.0,4.02
result all zero,10330.8,4.26
and let's just print the type of first,10333.02,4.339
result,10335.06,2.299
okay and this is simply the,10339.92,7.58
type of,10344.66,2.84
first result,10347.66,2.779
okay so result was of the type cursor,10357.56,5.339
then or cursor result then result.all,10359.779,6.381
was of the type list and finally result,10362.899,6.661
first result is of the type Legacy row,10366.16,5.26
okay,10369.56,4.02
now,10371.42,4.2
I don't know how to work with Legacy row,10373.58,3.42
I don't know how to work with all these,10375.62,3.18
special classes I know how to work with,10377.0,3.6
lists and dictionaries,10378.8,5.04
so I might want to convert this row into,10380.6,4.799
a dictionary because ultimately what,10383.84,3.78
each row of a database contains is a,10385.399,3.781
bunch of columns and a bunch of values,10387.62,5.34
for each column so let me search how to,10389.18,6.48
convert SQL,10392.96,4.319
Alchemy,10395.66,3.779
row into dictionary,10397.279,5.16
into python dict,10399.439,5.221
okay,10402.439,4.92
so there's an exact question how to,10404.66,5.04
convert SQL Alchemy row object to a,10407.359,4.801
python dictionary and that is how a lot,10409.7,3.9
of programming works you just search the,10412.16,3.239
right question and you get the answer,10413.6,5.879
and looks like what the way you do it is,10415.399,6.841
you just do underscore underscore dict,10419.479,5.581
underscore underscore,10422.24,5.28
so let's go back here and let's say,10425.06,4.56
first result,10427.52,6.78
dict equals result all which is a list 0,10429.62,6.779
which gives us a legacy result dot,10434.3,3.84
underscore underscore dick underscore,10436.399,3.781
underscore okay there's no way I could,10438.14,3.6
have guessed this I just had to look it,10440.18,3.32
up right so that's an important part of,10441.74,4.92
development and now let's check the type,10443.5,4.779
of first,10446.66,4.98
result date and make sure that it is a,10448.279,4.5
dictionary,10451.64,3.299
so I'm just also going to type this out,10452.779,4.401
here,10454.939,2.241
type of first result,10457.819,4.881
date,10460.22,2.48
and while we write it let's also print,10467.0,4.88
first result date,10468.859,3.021
okay so let's run this once again,10473.72,4.46
all right well,10483.74,7.28
could not locate column in row,10486.319,4.701
okay maybe this did not work maybe we,10492.979,4.201
can try another approach let me try this,10495.26,4.74
let me just call dict on this let me,10497.18,4.98
just call dict and see if maybe that,10500.0,4.58
works,10502.16,2.42
okay that actually worked so all we had,10514.279,5.101
to do is we had to call the dict,10517.58,3.84
function so I just took a guess here and,10519.38,3.42
sometimes you have to try a couple of,10521.42,4.559
approaches and what that did is it took,10522.8,5.099
one row of result and converted that,10525.979,3.42
into a python dictionary you can see,10527.899,3.361
here this is a python dictionary it,10529.399,4.681
contains the ID title Etc so now here's,10531.26,5.76
what I can do I get the result and I can,10534.08,4.859
say,10537.02,6.0
result dicts equals the empty list and I,10538.939,8.641
can say for Row in result dot all so,10543.02,6.54
result.all is going to be a list and for,10547.58,3.96
row and result at all each we are going,10549.56,4.2
to get one row each and then I'm just,10551.54,6.72
going to say result dicks dot append,10553.76,7.62
dict row okay and let's get rid of all,10558.26,5.219
that,10561.38,5.7
and finally let's just print result,10563.479,6.201
predict,10567.08,2.6
okay and or result text and let's run,10569.899,6.481
that one last time and we'll see why all,10574.1,3.54
how all of this is going to come,10576.38,3.439
together,10577.64,2.179
okay so now we have this list of,10581.84,5.04
dictionaries you can see here that this,10585.14,3.54
is a list and inside this list this is,10586.88,4.2
one object and then here inside this,10588.68,4.44
list this is the second object right so,10591.08,4.5
we had two jobs and the responsibilities,10593.12,4.62
for two of those jobs and now all of,10595.58,3.779
that data has come up here so we,10597.74,3.48
inserted that data from our MySQL,10599.359,3.901
workbench and we are getting that data,10601.22,5.82
into replit okay so this is good but we,10603.26,5.76
probably don't want to print this,10607.04,3.48
information we actually want to send,10609.02,3.839
this information back to the site when,10610.52,4.62
we are trying to access the job page so,10612.859,3.721
when we are trying to access Jovin,10615.14,2.46
careers,10616.58,3.3
dot x y z,10617.6,4.32
this is where we want to print the this,10619.88,3.24
is where we want to display this,10621.92,4.68
information right so let's get rid of,10623.12,5.34
this for now and I'm just going to copy,10626.6,4.02
this code actually I'm just going to,10628.46,5.06
copy all of this code,10630.62,2.9
and let's get rid of this and let's come,10635.24,7.4
back into our app.pi file,10638.359,4.281
and in our app.pi file let's come back,10643.64,5.58
here into the hello Jovian into the main,10646.52,4.44
route that we had and let's define a,10649.22,2.82
function,10650.96,3.54
let's call it load jobs,10652.04,8.12
from DB okay and what this does is with,10654.5,8.58
engine.connect as con and we have to,10660.16,5.68
just fix the indentation here,10663.08,5.699
yeah so with engine.connect as con and,10665.84,4.38
there is an error because we need to,10668.779,4.261
import engine so I can say here from,10670.22,5.16
database now because we have this file,10673.04,4.26
database we can use it like a module so,10675.38,3.54
this is the other way of using python,10677.3,3.78
files you can invoke them as a module so,10678.92,4.62
from database import engine,10681.08,5.64
so now from the database file where we,10683.54,5.34
had created the engine we are importing,10686.72,4.46
that engine inside app,10688.88,6.0
.pi and then we are saying inside our,10691.18,6.219
load jobs from DB function with,10694.88,5.7
engine.connect as con,10697.399,5.641
result equals con dot execute and there,10700.58,4.199
is this text so let's import that as,10703.04,4.819
well so from SQL,10704.779,5.761
Alchemy import,10707.859,5.381
text great,10710.54,5.04
so now text should be fine I believe,10713.24,5.88
it's from SQL alchemy.sql if I'm not,10715.58,5.58
mistaken let's see here,10719.12,5.279
okay no just SQL Alchemy so,10721.16,5.58
let's remove text from here let's come,10724.399,5.701
back into app.pi,10726.74,3.36
and we probably don't need this yeah,10732.14,5.48
okay so with,10734.18,5.04
engine.connect.com.execute and get a,10737.62,3.46
result then instead of calling this,10739.22,3.66
result dicks basically this is just a,10741.08,3.239
list of jobs right so I'm just going to,10742.88,4.32
call this jobs and I'm going to get each,10744.319,4.381
row from the result and I'm going to,10747.2,3.06
convert that row into a dictionary I'm,10748.7,3.84
going to append it to the list jobs and,10750.26,4.559
finally I'm going to return jobs,10752.54,5.04
okay great so now we have this function,10754.819,5.16
load jobs from DB,10757.58,5.279
and that function returns a list of jobs,10759.979,5.641
so now I can go in here and I can say,10762.859,5.241
jobs,10765.62,2.48
equals,10769.58,2.84
load jobs from DB,10775.04,4.92
great,10778.34,6.479
and now I can go ahead and remove this,10779.96,6.54
so,10784.819,3.421
before I do this I just want to show you,10786.5,3.72
the old version the version that we have,10788.24,4.64
currently running,10790.22,2.66
yeah so the version that we have,10800.359,3.361
currently running you can see here it,10801.859,3.96
contains four roles data analysts data,10803.72,3.42
scientists front-end engineer back-end,10805.819,3.481
engineer and that is coming from this,10807.14,6.08
list but let's get rid of this list,10809.3,3.92
and let's come here and let's call load,10813.859,6.241
jobs from DB,10817.46,5.04
and,10820.1,6.9
oops now for the jobs input let us,10822.5,7.02
provide jobs so we're saying jobs equals,10827.0,4.02
jobs basically what we're saying is,10829.52,4.56
inside the template home.html when you,10831.02,6.24
try to access the word jobs then you,10834.08,5.52
should be using the variable jobs that,10837.26,4.5
is defined here okay so don't let this,10839.6,4.86
notation confuse you this is the name,10841.76,4.04
that is going to be used inside,10844.46,4.2
home.html and this is the name that is,10845.8,5.08
the variable that you want to supply as,10848.66,4.56
the information so for example you can,10850.88,4.14
call it jobs list and then you would,10853.22,4.62
have to put jobs list here okay but just,10855.02,4.14
to keep it simple I'm going to call it,10857.84,3.36
jobs equals jobs,10859.16,4.14
and the company name is Joven so let's,10861.2,5.64
retain that okay so now I have just made,10863.3,5.22
a major change to my application I've,10866.84,3.8
actually removed all the,10868.52,4.86
hard-coded data and I am loading that,10870.64,4.78
information from a cloud-based database,10873.38,4.38
so now if I scroll down here you can see,10875.42,3.96
that there are two positions data,10877.76,4.559
analyst and data scientist and those are,10879.38,5.04
exactly the positions that we have,10882.319,3.781
entered into our database which we can,10884.42,4.62
verify in the MySQL workbench as well,10886.1,4.259
okay,10889.04,4.439
so I think that's pretty good it took,10890.359,4.981
some work but once you know how to do it,10893.479,5.041
the first time it is exactly the same,10895.34,5.099
thing each time or the entire code that,10898.52,4.14
we had to write was maybe just 11 lines,10900.439,4.021
of code and then we were able to create,10902.66,3.779
this helper function and you know what,10904.46,3.18
I'm just going to move this helper,10906.439,4.261
function inside database.pi so that,10907.64,6.679
I don't even have to worry about,10910.7,3.619
making sure my routes and functions are,10914.779,3.66
separated so I'm just going to put this,10916.76,2.46
here,10918.439,4.5
and let me put text back here and now in,10919.22,6.059
app.pi instead of importing something,10922.939,4.021
from SQL Alchemy or importing the engine,10925.279,5.101
I can just say load jobs from DB okay so,10926.96,5.64
this is good encapsulation good coding,10930.38,4.14
practice that all your database related,10932.6,4.14
logic is going to be here inside,10934.52,5.4
database dot pi and it simply has this,10936.74,5.28
function load jobs from DB which you can,10939.92,5.16
use inside app.pi,10942.02,6.419
okay so that I think was a good first,10945.08,5.46
step so now what we have done is we have,10948.439,4.261
connected to the database from replit,10950.54,4.92
using SQL Alchemy and then we also went,10952.7,4.68
ahead and we displayed the list of jobs,10955.46,5.46
from the cloud DB using SQL Alchemy,10957.38,7.38
so just to recap we started by,10960.92,5.76
creating a copy of the GitHub project,10964.76,4.26
that we had the last time and then we,10966.68,4.139
opened it up on replit and we also,10969.02,4.259
deployed it to render.com,10970.819,4.141
that was pretty straightforward just,10973.279,3.841
repeating what we had done the last time,10974.96,4.92
then we set up a cloud mySQL database on,10977.12,4.5
planetscale.com so we went to,10979.88,3.899
planetscale.com created a new database,10981.62,3.48
and then we,10983.779,3.841
used the credentials from the planet,10985.1,5.219
scale setup to connect to the database,10987.62,5.04
so we connected to the database from the,10990.319,5.04
MySQL workbench and we created a jobs,10992.66,4.68
table and this was the code used to,10995.359,4.381
create the jobs table and then we added,10997.34,4.62
data into it in the MySQL workbench,10999.74,5.3
using insert statements but also using,11001.96,6.6
the user interface not only can you add,11005.04,5.14
data you can also update data and you,11008.56,3.24
can also delete information for example,11010.18,3.299
I can click delete here and then click,11011.8,4.08
apply and that can delete information as,11013.479,3.601
well,11015.88,3.72
then we saw how to collect connect to,11017.08,4.68
the database from replit using SQL,11019.6,5.28
Alchemy so we created we imported the,11021.76,5.219
SQL Alchemy Library we created a,11024.88,4.68
database connection string and then we,11026.979,6.481
created an engine and finally we created,11029.56,6.24
a helper function to connect to the,11033.46,4.56
engine and execute the statement select,11035.8,5.4
star from jobs and finally get the,11038.02,5.64
result and convert the rows of the,11041.2,4.619
result into dictionaries and create a,11043.66,3.84
list of dictionaries which would just be,11045.819,4.261
the list of jobs and pass that into app,11047.5,5.88
dot pi and now instead of having a list,11050.08,5.1
of dictionaries that we had hard coded,11053.38,3.84
put into our code we are now getting the,11055.18,3.84
list of dictionaries from the database,11057.22,3.66
and I'm going to change this here as,11059.02,5.18
well into this other API which was using,11060.88,5.64
jsonify and I'm going to do the same,11064.2,6.1
thing load jobs from DB and jsonify jobs,11066.52,6.48
and now if I go back here and open the,11070.3,6.059
site and go to slash API jobs see this,11073.0,5.819
other API this this other route is at,11076.359,4.441
slash API slash jobs so I'm going to,11078.819,5.46
open slash API slash jobs,11080.8,5.519
and you can see here that this is the,11084.279,5.341
Json format of the information here,11086.319,6.801
which is the exact same thing,11089.62,3.5
except on the main page we are taking,11094.66,4.98
that Json data and we are displaying it,11097.3,4.92
but here we are just displaying it as,11099.64,5.639
plain Json okay and of course how do we,11102.22,5.52
put the data from the jobs dictionary,11105.279,4.321
how do we actually display that data,11107.74,4.079
here all of that is done inside this,11109.6,5.52
template home.html so inside home.html,11111.819,4.801
we have this,11115.12,4.38
for Loop so we say for job in jobs so we,11116.62,5.04
get each dictionary out so we get each,11119.5,4.979
dictionary out from the list of jobs and,11121.66,5.18
then we pass that information into job,11124.479,6.061
item.html and job item.html contains,11126.84,6.639
information here like it it extracts a,11130.54,5.58
job title so it is going to take this,11133.479,4.201
dictionary here,11136.12,3.239
and it is going to extract the title,11137.68,3.84
which is data analyst and it is going to,11139.359,5.58
put that title here inside an H4 tag,11141.52,5.16
then it is going to extract the location,11144.939,4.741
and display the location here and it is,11146.68,5.34
going to extract the salary and display,11149.68,4.08
the salary here,11152.02,5.1
so that's rather nice now let's go back,11153.76,5.4
into the MySQL workbench and insert a,11157.12,3.84
third job role and let's see what,11159.16,2.64
happens,11160.96,3.42
so let's go into here let's go into,11161.8,4.2
front-end developer let's grab that,11164.38,3.86
let's put that in here,11166.0,6.68
so front-end developer is the role,11168.24,4.44
okay now let's come back here let's grab,11174.04,5.1
location the location is remote so I'm,11176.859,4.141
going to come in here I'm going to paste,11179.14,2.759
that,11181.0,4.939
let's grab the salary here,11181.899,4.04
and I'm going to come in here and paste,11187.0,5.04
that let's grab this is still in rupees,11188.979,5.581
so let's grab that and let's put that in,11192.04,4.26
here,11194.56,6.9
and then let's put this in here as well,11196.3,7.38
all right last piece is the requirement,11201.46,4.2
so responsibilities and requirements and,11203.68,3.48
let's put that in here we are not using,11205.66,3.9
these yet but we will soon enough,11207.16,5.159
okay and I have not added an ID because,11209.56,5.58
an ID will get added automatically so,11212.319,5.101
I'm just going to click apply and now,11215.14,3.42
that's going to create this insert,11217.42,3.0
statement for us and now we're going to,11218.56,5.339
apply it and looks like it's done so now,11220.42,6.18
here is the most interesting thing we,11223.899,4.801
have not made any changes to our code,11226.6,7.14
but if I go here and reload this page,11228.7,6.779
you will now see that the front-end,11233.74,3.539
developer code shows up so what's,11235.479,3.84
happening is when we visit Jovian,11237.279,3.561
Courier's website,11239.319,4.261
v2.akashness.reple.com then,11240.84,6.28
a request is sent from your browser,11243.58,6.12
to this flask server that is running,11247.12,3.6
here,11249.7,3.9
and the flask server here is listening,11250.72,4.32
for requests so that is why it's called,11253.6,3.9
a server because it listens for requests,11255.04,4.92
and it serves some information back so,11257.5,4.26
it listened for the request,11259.96,4.859
and based on the request it went into,11261.76,5.4
the app routes and it checked which is,11264.819,4.021
the matching route so here we are just,11267.16,3.659
using the domain itself you're not doing,11268.84,3.72
slash API or anything we're just using,11270.819,5.16
the top level route and that is matched,11272.56,5.64
using slash which is that there is,11275.979,5.041
nothing after the domain name and then,11278.2,6.18
it invokes that function again so each,11281.02,5.48
timer request is made from the browser,11284.38,6.059
the appropriate function is invoked and,11286.5,6.279
in that function we are making a call to,11290.439,4.441
the database so the appropriate database,11292.779,3.961
query is made the appropriate SQL,11294.88,4.68
queries made by SQL alchemy that data is,11296.74,5.1
fetched then that data is passed into,11299.56,4.44
this template and that data is then,11301.84,5.16
displayed on the server right so this is,11304.0,5.22
already a dynamic web page this is no,11307.0,4.38
longer the same you're not going to get,11309.22,4.08
back the same result each time you open,11311.38,3.72
it up because there may be different,11313.3,4.32
information within the database so that,11315.1,4.32
is very powerful because that this one,11317.62,4.8
page now is not a static page it is it,11319.42,5.88
has some data that can be fetched from a,11322.42,5.82
database but now let's take this and let,11325.3,6.12
us also deploy it to render.com so to,11328.24,5.22
deploy to render.com all we have to do,11331.42,4.019
is take all the code that we have,11333.46,4.26
written and put it back on GitHub but,11335.439,4.681
there is one problem there is one very,11337.72,4.62
big problem that we have to fix,11340.12,5.4
here inside the database dot Pi file we,11342.34,5.88
have our database username password host,11345.52,5.04
all of this sensitive information now,11348.22,4.86
this information if it goes into the,11350.56,4.44
GitHub repository and the GitHub,11353.08,4.5
repository is public then everybody in,11355.0,5.04
the world will be able to see our main,11357.58,4.38
root database password which means,11360.04,3.899
anybody can directly connect to our,11361.96,4.08
database and delete information or,11363.939,4.261
change information you probably don't,11366.04,4.8
want that that is a big security risk so,11368.2,4.32
what we should be doing is we should be,11370.84,4.5
making this information a secret never,11372.52,5.7
put any passwords into a git repository,11375.34,4.139
because,11378.22,3.12
if you're going to share that repository,11379.479,3.3
with other people or if you're going to,11381.34,3.36
publish that repository online publicly,11382.779,4.62
your passwords will get exposed and,11384.7,4.32
anybody can come in and wipe out your,11387.399,2.641
database,11389.02,4.56
so generally all development and,11390.04,6.0
deployment platforms provide a way of,11393.58,5.46
storing some secret information which is,11396.04,5.16
stored differently from the git,11399.04,5.52
repository so I'm going to go here into,11401.2,5.46
the sidebar and just move down and here,11404.56,3.36
you see there is something called,11406.66,4.14
secrets so I'm going to go into Secrets,11407.92,4.5
here I'm going to click secrets and I'm,11410.8,3.179
going to create a new Secret inside,11412.42,3.899
replet and I'm going to call this secret,11413.979,4.261
DB,11416.319,3.721
connection,11418.24,4.92
string okay all uppercase with separated,11420.04,6.12
by underscore I'm going to take this,11423.16,5.4
text which is inside the codes and now,11426.16,4.5
we don't need the quotes anymore and I'm,11428.56,4.259
going to put this value here and I'm,11430.66,4.739
going to add new Secret,11432.819,5.821
and now replit will securely store this,11435.399,5.641
information within our replied account,11438.64,4.86
and this information will not be public,11441.04,4.859
this information will be private to us,11443.5,4.2
even if your Apple is public okay,11445.899,4.021
because this is secret information,11447.7,4.94
so DB connection string is now secret,11449.92,5.7
and then the way you can then get this,11452.64,5.44
information is using the OS module this,11455.62,6.3
is now available as a OS operate as an,11458.08,6.18
operating system environment variable so,11461.92,5.519
what you do is you say OS dot Enviro and,11464.26,4.38
Environ,11467.439,2.521
DB,11468.64,4.32
connection Str so you simply give the,11469.96,5.22
name of the secret and you say OS dot,11472.96,6.319
Environ and now if we run,11475.18,4.099
I think we have to go back and maybe,11480.34,5.34
reload the page so let's reload once,11481.96,6.12
okay it is called DB connection string,11485.68,3.9
so let me change that to DB connection,11488.08,2.88
string,11489.58,4.14
and now if we run,11490.96,6.8
we are going to see that,11493.72,4.04
DB connection string the connection,11498.64,3.719
string is no longer mentioned here in,11500.2,4.32
the code but the data is still getting,11502.359,4.321
loaded data analyst data scientist and,11504.52,4.74
front-end developer okay important Point,11506.68,5.34
remember this don't put any passwords or,11509.26,4.86
any sensitive information into your code,11512.02,4.56
it should always be passed through some,11514.12,6.18
secret okay so now let's go into Version,11516.58,6.12
Control here and I believe we have,11520.3,4.139
removed all the secrets here so I can,11522.7,4.02
now push my changes,11524.439,5.701
and let's see what did I change added,11526.72,5.88
connection to database,11530.14,4.259
added connection to DB let's just say,11532.6,2.82
that,11534.399,3.481
and let's click commit and push,11535.42,4.32
and that should take all the files and,11537.88,4.26
send it to GitHub that's what we were,11539.74,5.94
doing in the previous tutorial okay,11542.14,5.52
looks like nothing happened looks like,11545.68,4.5
there's no change here so what happened,11547.66,4.38
turns out that replit seems to have,11550.18,3.84
changed their user interface again this,11552.04,3.6
is something that happens with the tools,11554.02,2.879
that we use they're always making,11555.64,3.0
changes making improvements so things,11556.899,4.141
may not work exactly the same way and,11558.64,4.139
now you see this plus button it is,11561.04,3.96
showing you a list of all the files that,11562.779,4.62
are changed and you have to manually add,11565.0,5.04
which files you want to commit back to,11567.399,5.101
git okay so replied is giving you a,11570.04,4.439
little more power it is allowing you to,11572.5,4.319
manually add which files you want to,11574.479,4.021
commit to git so I'm going to click plus,11576.819,5.04
plus plus plus and now all these files,11578.5,5.279
are going to get committed I'm going to,11581.859,4.821
try to commit again,11583.779,2.901
load jobs from DB and I'm going to click,11586.72,6.3
commit and push and now that's going to,11589.6,5.94
take all of these added files earlier no,11593.02,4.02
file was added so that's why no nothing,11595.54,3.0
was getting committed so now it's going,11597.04,3.3
to take all these added files and it is,11598.54,3.72
going to commit them now you can see,11600.34,4.86
here we have load jobs from DB this is,11602.26,5.94
the latest commit and you can also go,11605.2,5.34
into Joven couriers website V2 and here,11608.2,4.44
on the job in careers website V2 you can,11610.54,4.2
now check app.pi,11612.64,4.38
you can see it doesn't have those list,11614.74,4.38
of jobs and you can check database dot,11617.02,4.44
pi and you can see it does not have any,11619.12,5.699
secret here okay so that's fine so now,11621.46,6.24
we have securely stored this Secret,11624.819,6.12
inside replet environment variables and,11627.7,5.82
we have still been able to make our code,11630.939,6.38
public so we've not lost any security,11633.52,6.0
nobody will be able to connect to our,11637.319,4.781
database except through,11639.52,5.1
the routes that we have already defined,11642.1,4.799
so the way people access the database is,11644.62,5.1
by opening the page Jovian careers,11646.899,5.341
website V2 and then that route,11649.72,4.139
internally makes a database connection,11652.24,3.659
but we get to control which database,11653.859,3.96
connections are possible we have not,11655.899,4.561
given the final user the full power over,11657.819,4.5
our database okay,11660.46,3.72
all this is well and good but let's go,11662.319,3.721
to render.com and let's see what,11664.18,3.06
happened here,11666.04,4.2
let's go into our render dashboard,11667.24,5.46
and let's find the,11670.24,5.119
project,11672.7,2.659
that we had just deployed earlier okay,11675.399,5.341
okay looks like a deploy failed so let's,11678.76,3.66
click on this let's see why a deployment,11680.74,4.1
failed,11682.42,2.42
so as soon as we pushed some new changes,11686.26,5.28
to master render.com try to deploy but,11688.779,4.921
when render.com tried to deploy it ran,11691.54,3.779
into a couple of issues looks like there,11693.7,4.8
is no module called SQL Alchemy so let's,11695.319,5.341
go back here we added a new a couple of,11698.5,3.899
new files so let's go in here let's add,11700.66,4.44
SQL Alchemy and I believe we also,11702.399,5.161
installed Pi MySQL so let's add Pi MySQL,11705.1,5.7
as well and let's go back here into,11707.56,6.36
Version Control let's call this update,11710.8,5.7
requirements,11713.92,4.859
and let's add this file into our commit,11716.5,5.54
and let's commit and push,11718.779,3.261
since we have added new libraries we,11722.56,3.299
need to mention them in requirements.txt,11724.24,3.18
now we have mentioned them now we can,11725.859,3.601
come back into render now let's go back,11727.42,4.76
into the dashboard,11729.46,2.72
now you can see it is deploying again so,11733.96,4.26
let's come back here let us check the,11736.18,4.02
deploy the deploy has been started it is,11738.22,4.639
in progress,11740.2,2.659
and you can see the name of the latest,11743.52,4.419
commit update requirements so let's wait,11745.54,4.5
here and let's see if it is able to,11747.939,6.201
build and deploy successfully,11750.04,4.1
okay looks like it was able to install,11755.979,3.601
all the dependencies looks like it is,11757.84,4.139
also able to build it and looks like it,11759.58,4.56
is now going to upload the build let's,11761.979,5.661
see if that is going to succeed,11764.14,3.5
okay the build was successful it is now,11769.3,3.599
deploying,11771.34,3.42
so this is going to get deployed to,11772.899,3.661
joviencareers.com,11774.76,3.9
and let's see if that deployment goes,11776.56,4.759
through successfully,11778.66,2.659
okay now here you see it runs into an,11781.84,5.28
error so it set up the build and then it,11784.84,4.559
tried to run geonicon app colon app and,11787.12,4.319
then when it tried to access if you just,11789.399,4.38
go down scroll down here when it try to,11791.439,4.681
access the OS dot Environ DB connection,11793.779,4.021
string it did not find the connection,11796.12,3.239
string so,11797.8,3.3
what happened,11799.359,3.841
remember this connection string is a,11801.1,4.679
secret that we have put into replit when,11803.2,4.86
we sent the code from replit to GitHub,11805.779,4.08
GitHub no longer had that connection,11808.06,3.78
string that's the whole purpose of,11809.859,3.96
storing it secretly on replit so that it,11811.84,4.019
we don't expose it in our git repository,11813.819,4.321
so if the git repository doesn't have,11815.859,4.381
this information then obviously,11818.14,3.839
render.com will also not have this,11820.24,4.14
information so what we need to do is go,11821.979,4.081
into render.com,11824.38,4.2
go into the environment here so just,11826.06,5.28
like replit render.com also has a way of,11828.58,4.44
specifying Secrets or environment,11831.34,4.019
variables it specifically says that you,11833.02,5.879
can use this for secrets and then click,11835.359,5.101
Plus,11838.899,3.721
and now we can go back here and let me,11840.46,4.319
go to the secrets Tab and let me click,11842.62,3.84
on the secret that I already have and,11844.779,3.361
let's grab the name DB underscore,11846.46,4.08
connection underscore string and let's,11848.14,5.219
put that name here and let's grab the,11850.54,3.6
value,11853.359,4.861
and let's put this value here as well DB,11854.14,5.759
underscore connection underscore string,11858.22,3.96
and save these changes,11859.899,4.021
and that is going to kick off another,11862.18,3.599
deploy,11863.92,5.16
most likely so let's go back here,11865.779,5.281
yeah so it looks like we have just,11869.08,3.6
updated the environment so it is going,11871.06,3.54
to start another deployment,11872.68,3.96
and this time it should be able to,11874.6,3.839
access the environment variables so,11876.64,4.98
let's go back here and let's see,11878.439,6.0
how it's doing so it is,11881.62,5.159
once again installing the required,11884.439,4.561
libraries it has,11886.779,5.16
created a build it is then going to push,11889.0,4.74
the build and it is finally going to try,11891.939,3.601
another deployment and it's going to try,11893.74,4.14
to run the application once again so far,11895.54,4.68
jovencareers.com,11897.88,4.68
if we just check it Jovian,11900.22,5.52
careers.com so far it only has the old,11902.56,4.68
data data analyst data scientist,11905.74,3.119
front-end engineer and back-end engineer,11907.24,4.86
so it has all this information right,11908.859,5.941
but as soon as this deploy is done,11912.1,5.219
hopefully if it works it should be,11914.8,7.08
connected to the actual database,11917.319,6.801
foreign,11921.88,2.24
looks like this has run properly so,11924.6,4.6
let's reload the page and you can see,11927.34,3.66
now we have data analysts data scientist,11929.2,4.14
and front-end developer data analyst,11931.0,4.2
data scientist and front-end developer,11933.34,4.439
let me just try this one more change,11935.2,6.48
here so let's add backend developer,11937.779,6.601
and let's change this to San,11941.68,5.48
Francisco,11944.38,2.78
USA,11947.439,4.081
let's make this 120,11948.819,4.381
000.,11951.52,5.28
let's put the dollar symbol here and,11953.2,5.4
let's grab the information about this,11956.8,3.42
job as well so here there is some,11958.6,2.94
information too,11960.22,3.96
so let's grab that,11961.54,4.92
and there is some information here too,11964.18,6.139
so let's grab that too,11966.46,3.859
and let's click apply,11972.22,4.679
and that should now insert this new data,11974.38,5.16
and now if we simply refresh,11976.899,5.401
jovencareers.com,11979.54,4.92
you will now see that it has all four,11982.3,4.559
roles and you can tell that this is,11984.46,4.019
coming from the database you can try to,11986.859,3.42
delete something from the database and,11988.479,3.901
that will go away from here,11990.279,5.04
great so now we are able to deploy it as,11992.38,5.04
well,11995.319,3.901
so now we've deployed to render.com,11997.42,3.78
we've pushed the changes to GitHub we,11999.22,4.02
have kept our secret safe and we have,12001.2,4.92
deployed to render.com next we are now,12003.24,4.739
going to create Dynamic pages to display,12006.12,4.68
each job role now wouldn't it be nice if,12007.979,5.521
we had for each of these job roles on,12010.8,4.679
jovencareers.com we had its own page,12013.5,3.72
maybe we got there when we clicked on,12015.479,4.441
apply so let's try to do that let's try,12017.22,5.88
to give each of these jobs their own,12019.92,4.859
page,12023.1,3.839
so let's come back here I am going to,12024.779,4.981
come back here into requirements,12026.939,5.521
into our app.pi file and I'm going to,12029.76,4.08
add a new route,12032.46,4.439
so I'm going to say app dot route,12033.84,4.86
slash,12036.899,7.801
job and now what I want is,12038.7,8.159
on jobin dot careers jovencareers.com,12044.7,5.76
job slash three let's say if I put the,12046.859,5.821
number three I want the data for job ID,12050.46,4.56
number three to be displayed here,12052.68,4.32
and if I put the number two I want the,12055.02,3.839
job data for the job ID to to be,12057.0,3.42
displayed here and so on,12058.859,4.381
so the way you can create a dynamic,12060.42,5.7
route in flask is by putting something,12063.24,5.64
between these less than and greater than,12066.12,5.58
symbols so if we do less than ID greater,12068.88,5.399
than so now it is no longer trying to,12071.7,5.64
match slash job slash ID now it will,12074.279,5.16
match anything that comes after slash,12077.34,4.8
job and the function that you define,12079.439,5.281
under it let's call this,12082.14,5.219
show job is going to receive that value,12084.72,5.04
as a parameter so for example if we try,12087.359,5.521
to access jobin careers.com job three,12089.76,6.08
you can see here in the URL bar,12092.88,7.2
jovencareers.com job slash three then ID,12095.84,7.9
will get the value 3. so ID will get the,12100.08,5.76
value 3 so basically ID will be the,12103.74,4.92
number that we have passed in and now we,12105.84,5.22
can first try to load the job so let's,12108.66,5.159
see load job from DB so we'll try to,12111.06,5.46
load a specific job here which has this,12113.819,4.981
given ID and then,12116.52,4.919
let's for now let's just,12118.8,5.76
convert that into Json so jsonify job,12121.439,6.181
and return that okay now we don't have a,12124.56,4.919
load job from DB function so let's,12127.62,6.6
define that inside our database file so,12129.479,9.061
let's define def load job from DB which,12134.22,5.58
takes an ID,12138.54,6.18
and now we say with engine dot connect,12139.8,7.5
as con,12144.72,6.9
and then we say result equals con dot,12147.3,5.58
execute,12151.62,3.18
so what with what is this SQL query we,12152.88,4.14
want to write typically when we want to,12154.8,4.44
fetch a specific job we would use a,12157.02,4.62
select query so we would do something,12159.24,4.02
like select,12161.64,6.6
star from jobs where ID equals 3 for,12163.26,6.059
example,12168.24,3.18
and that is the front-end developer role,12169.319,4.561
right so that's exactly what we want to,12171.42,5.1
write here as well text,12173.88,6.18
so let's get that on new line,12176.52,5.16
select,12180.06,3.18
star,12181.68,5.88
from jobs where,12183.24,4.32
ID equals and now here we want to put,12189.899,6.0
the value of the variable ID so the way,12193.08,5.1
you can do this is you can just put a,12195.899,4.701
variable here so let me call this Val,12198.18,6.059
and then outside this you can provide,12200.6,5.32
the value of Val so you can say Val,12204.239,4.5
equals ID,12205.92,7.2
okay so this is what is called string,12208.739,6.181
formatting but it is done in a special,12213.12,6.239
way inside SQL alchemy that you use,12214.92,6.78
colon to specify that this is something,12219.359,4.321
that has to be filled in and then you,12221.7,4.619
provide its value as a parameter here,12223.68,5.82
okay so where ID equals Val and we are,12226.319,4.801
saying that colon Val should get,12229.5,3.66
replaced by ID and where is this ID,12231.12,4.38
coming from this ID is coming from this,12233.16,5.159
input and where is it coming from in the,12235.5,3.72
input,12238.319,3.481
remember app.pi we are actually getting,12239.22,4.139
it from the URL so we are getting the,12241.8,4.74
URL ID from the URL and we are putting,12243.359,5.341
it into this function load job from DB,12246.54,5.58
and let's call load job from DB let's,12248.7,4.8
import that,12252.12,2.94
so we are putting it into the function,12253.5,3.54
load job from DB,12255.06,4.379
and inside load job from DB we are,12257.04,4.5
taking the ID and we are putting it into,12259.439,3.721
the select statement select star from,12261.54,3.96
jobs where ID equals well and then we,12263.16,4.14
are going to execute it and we're going,12265.5,3.479
to get a result,12267.3,5.639
now we can say rows equals result dot,12268.979,6.721
all so now we have a list of rows now I,12272.939,6.121
expect to get back either one row or I,12275.7,4.92
expect to get back zero rows for example,12279.06,3.839
if I look for the job with ID 10 I'm,12280.62,4.319
going to get back 0 rows,12282.899,5.04
so here's what I'm going to do if Len,12284.939,4.441
rows,12287.939,4.081
equals 0,12289.38,6.0
then I'm going to return none,12292.02,6.959
else I am going to return,12295.38,7.26
dict rows 0.,12298.979,7.621
okay so remember rows is a list of rows,12302.64,7.62
and each element of row so this is going,12306.6,5.46
to be the first element of row row 0 is,12310.26,3.479
going to be the first element of row so,12312.06,3.78
the first element of row is going to be,12313.739,4.561
a legacy row a SQL Alchemy row class and,12315.84,4.08
we can convert that row into a,12318.3,4.439
dictionary using date okay and if this,12319.92,3.96
doesn't make sense what you should try,12322.739,2.281
and do is add a bunch of print,12323.88,2.76
statements and play around with it and,12325.02,4.14
try to make sense of it but now we have,12326.64,5.82
this load job from DB so we have that,12329.16,5.76
and now we have this app which is going,12332.46,5.64
to use load job from DB,12334.92,6.12
let's call it load job from DB,12338.1,7.799
and let's run that let's run this and,12341.04,6.48
for now what we're doing is we are,12345.899,3.0
getting the job data and we are just,12347.52,4.56
converting it in into Json okay so if I,12348.899,5.46
go now and open this up in a new page so,12352.08,3.779
remember this is not deployed yet so,12354.359,2.701
this is not going to be available on,12355.859,3.601
jovencareers.com just yet any code,12357.06,4.379
changes have to be deployed via render,12359.46,5.399
any database changes any changes made to,12361.439,5.161
the data within the database will,12364.859,3.781
reflect immediately that's the benefit,12366.6,4.139
of having a database that is separate,12368.64,4.32
from your code because once the code is,12370.739,3.781
deployed independently and the database,12372.96,3.899
can be changed and the data just changes,12374.52,3.66
independently,12376.859,3.54
anyway so now here we have the same,12378.18,5.88
development server running and here we,12380.399,5.821
have the data analyst role data,12384.06,3.78
scientist role front-end developer role,12386.22,4.62
so let's see here when we check the jobs,12387.84,6.059
table data analyst has the id1,12390.84,5.82
so I can go in here and I can type slash,12393.899,4.741
job slash one,12396.66,4.68
and that is going to go and match this,12398.64,3.48
route,12401.34,3.42
ID and ID is going to have the value 1,12402.12,4.5
we're going to load the job with the id1,12404.76,3.179
and we're going to then convert it into,12406.62,3.3
Json and return it,12407.939,4.741
and exactly what we expect we get the,12409.92,4.74
information about the data analyst role,12412.68,4.02
the salary we get the currency we get,12414.66,3.3
the ID and we get the location,12416.7,3.9
requirements and responsibilities,12417.96,5.22
so great that's nice so now we have a,12420.6,6.36
dynamic page let's try maybe this,12423.18,6.42
and yes now we have data scientist let's,12426.96,4.68
try three,12429.6,3.839
and now we have front-end developer,12431.64,4.32
let's try four and now we have backend,12433.439,4.5
developer so you may have heard the term,12435.96,4.8
rest API this is exactly what rest apis,12437.939,4.92
are they go into a database they fetch,12440.76,3.24
some information based on the,12442.859,2.941
information that you provide in the URL,12444.0,4.92
and they return some Json okay but we,12445.8,4.74
don't want a rest API right now we want,12448.92,4.08
to create a proper HTML page so I'm,12450.54,6.38
going to create a new template called,12453.0,5.58
jobpage.html,12456.92,3.22
and,12458.58,4.56
let's create a basic HTML page here from,12460.14,4.92
scratch so I can go into home.html and,12463.14,4.02
just study how this was created so there,12465.06,4.379
is a dock time HD doctype HTML at the,12467.16,4.8
top let me put that in here then there,12469.439,5.401
is an HTML tag and then there is a head,12471.96,4.74
and body tags inside it so let me put,12474.84,4.92
HTML and let's put a head in there,12476.7,7.079
and let's put a body in there and in the,12479.76,6.3
head we may have to put a few things so,12483.779,4.741
there is the title let me copy the title,12486.06,6.06
let's put that back into a job page,12488.52,5.759
great and now instead of jobin careers,12492.12,4.88
let's change it to the actual job name,12494.279,6.061
so let's get the job title here,12497.0,5.62
so let's get job dot title where is this,12500.34,3.78
job going to come from we are going to,12502.62,3.42
pass it in while rendering the template,12504.12,3.9
so,12506.04,3.72
let's just do that for now and maybe,12508.02,7.86
also inside the body let us put in maybe,12509.76,6.12
an H3 tag with the title of the job so,12516.96,6.479
let's put the title and let's put the,12521.7,4.94
job title below it in a P tag,12523.439,5.101
job.title,12526.64,4.0
okay we've done something very basic,12528.54,4.14
here we just have a title tag and then,12530.64,5.04
we have an H3 tag and now let me go back,12532.68,6.12
into app.pi and instead of returning,12535.68,5.46
Json let me render this template so let,12538.8,3.84
me say render,12541.14,4.139
template,12542.64,6.78
and let me use the template job page dot,12545.279,8.941
HTML and let me set job equals job okay,12549.42,7.26
so inside the template,12554.22,5.28
any references to job will use the,12556.68,5.099
valued job which is coming from load job,12559.5,4.38
from DB which is coming from ID,12561.779,6.12
so that's nice so now I can go back here,12563.88,7.38
and reload this page,12567.899,5.88
and now it says title backend developer,12571.26,4.92
okay maybe let's put in a few other,12573.779,4.261
things as well,12576.18,3.48
let's get,12578.04,4.699
maybe the,12579.66,3.079
all the other information basically so,12583.439,3.3
let's get,12585.359,4.161
the location,12586.739,2.781
job dot location,12591.84,5.899
let's get the salary,12594.239,3.5
job dot salary,12600.18,3.559
oops this is just called salary,12606.42,3.859
let's get,12622.939,3.361
requirements or let's get the currency,12626.479,4.3
or maybe let's put the currency next to,12628.5,3.96
the salary itself so,12630.779,4.5
that would be nice job dot currency we,12632.46,5.04
don't have to show it separately then we,12635.279,6.181
have the job responsibilities,12637.5,3.96
and job dot responsive,12644.52,5.4
abilities,12648.06,6.919
and then we have the job requirements so,12649.92,8.58
requirements and let's get that as well,12654.979,6.581
job DOT requirements,12658.5,5.16
okay now we have all the information and,12661.56,3.719
you can see even the title says backend,12663.66,3.659
developer so the title is back-end,12665.279,3.481
developer the location of San Francisco,12667.319,5.16
the salary is 120 000 responsibilities,12668.76,7.58
oh okay maybe there's a,12672.479,3.861
What's this called responsive ah I think,12679.859,6.061
I have a typo in my table,12683.04,5.279
so I've just called it responsibilities,12685.92,4.14
so let's just change here to,12688.319,3.54
responsibilities for now,12690.06,5.66
so that it at least it works,12691.859,3.861
and now we have the responsibilities as,12697.979,4.861
well what about this,12699.899,5.58
so here is the front-end developer,12702.84,6.3
here we have the data scientist and here,12705.479,6.181
we have the data analyst but what if we,12709.14,6.139
try to access something that's not there,12711.66,3.619
so it shows empty information but rather,12715.439,4.141
we should probably just show not found,12717.66,3.6
or something like that so I'm going to,12719.58,5.52
come back here into app.pi and I'm going,12721.26,5.66
to say if,12725.1,4.799
not job,12726.92,5.439
which means if job is none then simply,12729.899,5.101
return not found,12732.359,4.561
and whenever you're returning something,12735.0,4.5
you can also specify your error code so,12736.92,5.16
404 if you've seen HTTP error codes you,12739.5,3.84
may have come across four or four pages,12742.08,3.54
404 represents not found so it tells the,12743.34,4.08
browser that the page was not found so,12745.62,3.119
this is just a good way whenever you're,12747.42,3.0
returning errors to also apart from,12748.739,3.721
returning any content and this can just,12750.42,3.72
be the output of a template as well but,12752.46,3.3
apart from returning any content you can,12754.14,4.5
also return not found so if the job is,12755.76,5.28
not present then we say not found,12758.64,5.099
otherwise we render the template so now,12761.04,4.859
if I reload this you can see here it,12763.739,4.461
says,12765.899,2.301
foreign,12769.319,4.201
it should just say not found and here it,12770.58,4.56
you can see the browser also says this,12773.52,4.379
page is missing so the browser is also,12775.14,4.56
able to detect that this is Pages,12777.899,3.42
missing based on the error code but if,12779.7,4.739
we go back here into maybe job ID3 that,12781.319,5.341
information is present,12784.439,5.04
okay nice so now we have one page per,12786.66,5.579
job and it would be nice to maybe make,12789.479,4.441
it look nicer just like the main job,12792.239,3.66
page and also connect it here from the,12793.92,5.64
job page so right now on the job page we,12795.899,6.061
have this apply button which sends an,12799.56,4.5
email but instead of sending an email,12801.96,4.14
maybe we can just open the job Details,12804.06,3.66
page so that's the first thing we're,12806.1,4.56
going to do let me come into home.html,12807.72,6.36
and inside home.html looks like we Loop,12810.66,5.279
over the jobs using four and then we,12814.08,5.239
include job item.html so let's go into,12815.939,6.3
jobitem.html and here we have this mail,12819.319,5.201
to link so let's get rid of this mail to,12822.239,3.301
link,12824.52,3.06
and instead let's put a different link,12825.54,4.739
here so we are saying that when somebody,12827.58,5.54
clicks on apply,12830.279,2.841
we want to open on the same website we,12833.22,5.88
want to open slash jobs or sorry slash,12836.279,6.66
job slash the ID of the job for which we,12839.1,5.46
have this current button so here we have,12842.939,4.8
this job object so we can just say job,12844.56,4.679
ID,12847.739,6.2
and save that and reload it,12849.239,4.7
and now if you see here this you can see,12854.76,4.44
in the status bar at the bottom left,12857.399,3.901
that this actually opens up that,12859.2,3.779
specific job page,12861.3,2.7
okay,12862.979,2.941
so that's nice we have now opened up,12864.0,4.92
that specific job page that is good but,12865.92,6.12
I would prefer if this also looked,12868.92,5.46
somewhat similar to this page if they,12872.04,4.8
had similar layouts so let's try and do,12874.38,4.559
that so let's do that one by one the,12876.84,4.38
first thing we will do is fix things in,12878.939,3.241
the head,12881.22,3.179
so the job page currently just has a,12882.18,4.02
title maybe we should also include,12884.399,5.721
bootstrap in there so let me just,12886.2,8.039
get this and put all this in in there as,12890.12,4.9
well,12894.239,2.58
so this way is going to make sure that,12895.02,4.2
the bootstrap framework is imported but,12896.819,4.021
instead of copy pasting things this,12899.22,4.08
would be a good,12900.84,4.62
opportunity for us to maybe create,12903.3,4.559
another helper template so let me add a,12905.46,3.979
file called,12907.859,3.38
bootstrap.html,12909.439,4.121
bootstrap.html which can contain the,12911.239,4.12
code to include the bootstrap framework,12913.56,4.919
let me cut this here and let me come and,12915.359,5.341
paste this into bootstrap.html,12918.479,4.861
and let's just fix the indentation here,12920.7,5.159
so that things are easier to see,12923.34,5.04
and let's go into home and let's simply,12925.859,5.04
it include here bootstrap.html so,12928.38,6.2
percentage include,12930.899,3.681
bootstrap.html percentage great,12935.06,7.0
and now so you see the layout got messed,12938.7,5.4
up but now it's fixed again now we can,12942.06,3.9
come back into job page and under the,12944.1,4.379
title we can include bootstrap.html so,12945.96,4.88
that's nice,12948.479,2.361
okay so now if we come back here into a,12952.14,4.98
specific job page,12954.72,5.759
let's say I open,12957.12,6.3
data scientist,12960.479,4.981
you can see that already the Styles have,12963.42,4.08
become much better that's nice,12965.46,5.04
but next step would be to probably add,12967.5,5.34
the header probably add this Banner,12970.5,5.16
image so let's do that let's add the nav,12972.84,4.92
I think the nav is already a component,12975.66,4.14
in itself so I'm just going to grab this,12977.76,6.599
and put that inside job page.html,12979.8,6.24
and you can see now it should have the,12984.359,4.021
navigation bar but while we write it how,12986.04,4.02
about will it also grab the footer and,12988.38,3.96
put the footer in there as well so let's,12990.06,5.46
go back to job page and let's include,12992.34,6.8
the footer here at the bottom,12995.52,3.62
let's see if that has changed something,12999.479,4.26
so now we have the header that's nice,13002.12,4.5
now we have the footer as well and now,13003.739,4.861
let's go back in here and maybe add that,13006.62,4.08
Banner image as well so I'm going to go,13008.6,4.56
into home and there are two things here,13010.7,5.22
so there is this image and then there is,13013.16,5.159
a style tag as well so it turns out that,13015.92,4.2
style tags do not have to be in the head,13018.319,4.381
they can be anywhere in the body so I'm,13020.12,5.22
going to put this style tag right above,13022.7,3.779
this image,13025.34,4.08
and then I'm going to copy all this and,13026.479,5.161
I'm going to create a new file,13029.42,3.479
foreign,13031.64,3.66
er.html,13032.899,4.801
and I'm going to put that in here all of,13035.3,5.519
this inside banner.html,13037.7,5.94
and inside home I am going to Simply,13040.819,6.301
include banner.html,13043.64,3.48
okay and not only inside home but I'm,13049.22,5.16
going to do the same inside,13051.8,4.139
so the banner is still here I'm going to,13054.38,4.74
do the same Inside Job page.html,13055.939,5.941
okay so our website once we've created,13059.12,4.98
it for one page it's very easy to,13061.88,4.019
replicate across other pages,13064.1,4.02
now let's Center this a bit the way this,13065.899,4.5
is centered on the home is using a,13068.12,3.72
container you can see here we have a,13070.399,3.96
container so let's take that and maybe,13071.84,4.979
I'll also retain this careers Joven,13074.359,6.0
Courier's title here so let me also and,13076.819,5.101
let's get rid of this company name this,13080.359,3.661
is no longer useful so I'm just going to,13081.92,4.2
call it Jovian careers,13084.02,4.919
and in app.pi I'm going to remove this,13086.12,5.279
company name here that we had passed in,13088.939,5.04
earlier but let's go back to home and,13091.399,4.441
let's copy this container let's copy,13093.979,6.121
this H1 and let's take that and let's,13095.84,7.8
put that into jobpage.html,13100.1,7.56
and put all of this inside the container,13103.64,6.66
and let's close the div,13107.66,6.36
let's go back let's see that,13110.3,7.019
okay so it is starting to look pretty,13114.02,6.06
nice I would say we have the title,13117.319,4.5
location salary I think these are,13120.08,3.359
probably too big so maybe we can make,13121.819,3.901
these h4s,13123.439,5.46
and maybe let's make this H3 and just,13125.72,6.8
show the title here instead of saying,13128.899,3.621
yeah let's make this S3 and let us just,13132.8,4.2
show the job title here instead of,13134.899,3.781
showing this in a paragraph so just a,13137.0,4.56
slightly nicer layout and let's load the,13138.68,5.04
location here but let us display it,13141.56,6.96
using a P tag and let us give the class,13143.72,7.2
lead remember the class lead we had used,13148.52,3.48
the last time just to make the text,13150.92,5.66
bigger and let's make these all h4s,13152.0,4.58
okay and I'm going to move the salary,13163.22,4.019
below,13165.14,3.66
the,13167.239,4.2
requirements and responsibilities let's,13168.8,3.9
go back,13171.439,3.661
and I think we are almost there now we,13172.7,4.619
have data scientist New Delhi India okay,13175.1,4.62
maybe we don't need the space above so,13177.319,4.381
I'm just going to say,13179.72,4.82
class,13181.7,2.84
m,13186.08,4.92
maybe this is space below the,13187.76,5.24
heading so I'm just going to say class,13191.0,4.92
mb2 just reducing the space a little bit,13193.0,3.88
here,13195.92,3.12
okay and let's change this to a simple,13196.88,3.84
Mt 0,13199.04,3.72
so I'm just fixing a bit of spacing,13200.72,4.8
using some margin classes from bootstrap,13202.76,4.62
okay so nothing major this is just,13205.52,3.9
things that you have to mess around with,13207.38,3.899
a little bit okay so now we have data,13209.42,3.08
scientist New Delhi India,13211.279,4.021
responsibilities requirement salary but,13212.5,5.26
there's one problem here if I go back,13215.3,5.46
into the data that we had inserted the,13217.76,4.92
sample jobs data,13220.76,4.5
you can see here that there are,13222.68,4.679
multiple lines present here you can see,13225.26,4.44
that there is a next line after each of,13227.359,4.021
these points,13229.7,3.42
but these points don't seem to be,13231.38,4.26
showing up on this page so it would be,13233.12,5.52
nice to make these show up as pointers,13235.64,4.74
first of all instead of as a paragraph,13238.64,4.02
so it's not detecting the new lines and,13240.38,3.96
maybe we should also be using bullet,13242.66,4.38
points in some fashion here so let's do,13244.34,5.099
that let's make these bullet points and,13247.04,5.52
the way to make bullet points in HTML is,13249.439,4.861
using something called,13252.56,4.98
an unordered list so you say ul and as,13254.3,5.16
soon as you say UL now you've started a,13257.54,4.38
bulleted list and then inside it you put,13259.46,7.019
each element into its own Li tag so UL,13261.92,7.019
stands for unordered list and Li stands,13266.479,5.88
for list item so here you have item a,13268.939,6.54
here you have Item B and then here you,13272.359,3.841
have,13275.479,3.84
Li item C and so on and let me just save,13276.2,4.56
that and I'll show you what that looks,13279.319,3.601
like before we,13280.76,4.559
yeah so this is what it looks like item,13282.92,4.38
a Item B item C all we have to do is we,13285.319,3.781
have to put this inside,13287.3,3.059
ul and Li,13289.1,2.879
now,13290.359,4.62
our responsibilities is a single string,13291.979,4.92
although it does contain these new line,13294.979,4.5
characters and so what we need to do is,13296.899,6.241
we need to first split it into a bunch,13299.479,6.061
of lines a list of lines and then we,13303.14,4.32
need to Loop over those lines and create,13305.54,4.56
allies or list items,13307.46,4.8
so I'm just going to write the code here,13310.1,4.08
and I'll let you think about how that,13312.26,6.36
works so I'm going to say for line,13314.18,8.94
in job dot responsibilities,13318.62,7.02
or actually just responsibilities here,13323.12,4.92
so let me just call it that job doctors,13325.64,4.98
responsibilities dot split,13328.04,4.98
and I'm going to split it at the new,13330.62,3.72
line character,13333.02,2.82
okay so that's going to give me a list,13334.34,3.66
of lines and then I'm going to get each,13335.84,3.72
line from that list,13338.0,5.54
and let's put end for here,13339.56,3.98
and now here,13344.84,4.92
we can simply render the line inside a,13347.0,5.42
list item,13349.76,2.66
okay so this code is going to seem,13352.52,5.459
confusing right now but spend some time,13354.739,4.981
with it experiment with it a little bit,13357.979,4.201
and hopefully you'll see what it's doing,13359.72,5.219
we are taking responsibilities from the,13362.18,4.98
job we are splitting it at the new line,13364.939,3.901
character and new line characters are,13367.16,3.18
already present but they don't get,13368.84,4.439
rendered automatically in HTML for us so,13370.34,4.139
we're splitting it at the new line,13373.279,3.781
character and then we are looping over,13374.479,5.041
it so we get each line and for each line,13377.06,4.98
we create a list item okay so we if,13379.52,4.2
there are 10 responsibilities then it's,13382.04,3.899
going to create 10 allies and all of,13383.72,4.5
those allies are inside the UL and,13385.939,5.101
that's why you get back this,13388.22,5.04
okay so that's great that's nice so now,13391.04,4.92
we have a nice bulleted list here let's,13393.26,5.34
do this same thing for requirements,13395.96,5.58
instead of a bulleted list this time I'm,13398.6,4.86
going to create what's called a numbered,13401.54,3.899
list or an ordered list so instead of UL,13403.46,4.019
I'm going to use ol,13405.439,6.121
and I am going to then pass in,13407.479,7.201
the same for so I'm going to say,13411.56,5.04
4,13414.68,3.96
line in,13416.6,5.839
job DOT requirements,13418.64,3.799
and end for,13424.34,5.76
let's get the N4 from here,13426.38,5.88
and now the line each line is going to,13430.1,3.839
come from job DOT requirements and now,13432.26,3.12
I'm going to render,13433.939,4.321
the value of the line,13435.38,6.0
so these templates are very powerful you,13438.26,5.4
can do all sorts of manipulation data,13441.38,5.22
manipulation right within the template,13443.66,5.52
and now you see oops I think I went too,13446.6,4.98
far I should be splitting job,13449.18,4.44
requirements dot split so now we have,13451.58,4.08
created one item for every character,13453.62,4.199
that's not what we wanted so job,13455.66,5.159
requirements.split,13457.819,3.0
and now you see here that you have all,13461.0,4.92
the requirements in different lines as,13463.76,4.2
well so that's the requirements for the,13465.92,4.859
data scientist role let's check the data,13467.96,5.6
analyst role,13470.779,2.781
and that looks good let's check the,13474.38,4.58
backend engineer role that looks good,13479.96,3.359
too,13482.3,2.939
and that's it we've now created a bunch,13483.319,4.5
of different Dynamic pages,13485.239,5.7
powered by data from the database and we,13487.819,5.46
are making it look nice we're making it,13490.939,4.8
look pretty good maybe one other thing,13493.279,4.2
we can do is we can maybe make this,13495.739,4.441
button this this thing in a nav we can,13497.479,4.441
maybe configure it to go back to the,13500.18,5.16
home page so let's go back into nav.html,13501.92,6.78
so let's go to nav.html and here we have,13505.34,5.639
this a tag already and let us just,13508.7,5.46
change its location to slash so the word,13510.979,5.34
Jovian when we click on it it is going,13514.16,4.26
to take us back to the home page and,13516.319,3.181
it's important to have navigation,13518.42,3.42
otherwise your visitors website visitors,13519.5,3.84
may not be able to figure out how to go,13521.84,4.2
back even this is not very obvious but,13523.34,4.92
let me first reload this so now I want a,13526.04,3.48
job page here,13528.26,4.559
and if I click this,13529.52,5.339
that's going to now take me back to the,13532.819,2.941
home page,13534.859,2.821
and from the home page I can click on,13535.76,3.96
the apply page,13537.68,4.74
and that's going to bring me back to the,13539.72,4.98
job page and I can click here and go,13542.42,3.3
back,13544.7,3.48
into the job page and then click apply,13545.72,5.639
and go into a different page,13548.18,7.559
so great we've now created Dynamic pages,13551.359,6.361
so we've completed this step create,13555.739,5.16
Dynamic pages to display job role and we,13557.72,4.98
have now shared layout Styles and,13560.899,3.901
navigations using bootstrap,13562.7,3.9
between the two,13564.8,3.9
home between the home and the job Pages,13566.6,4.139
you should always try to share as much,13568.7,4.14
code as possible and that's how your,13570.739,3.841
style will stay consistent if you copy,13572.84,3.599
paste things then you can make change in,13574.58,3.3
one place and the change won't reflect,13576.439,3.42
in the other place so less code is,13577.88,4.2
always better so keep that in mind,13579.859,6.061
all right let's also finally just,13582.08,7.739
make save this to GitHub and then let,13585.92,6.479
that deploy to render.com,13589.819,5.16
so now we have added,13592.399,5.58
Dynamic Pages for,13594.979,4.981
each job,13597.979,4.081
let's commit and push that and that,13599.96,4.2
should get deployed in a couple of,13602.06,6.06
minutes to jovencareers.com,13604.16,3.96
so we've Now read from the database but,13610.399,4.021
now we'll see how to write data back to,13612.56,3.36
the database and that's going to,13614.42,4.14
complete the loop a fully functional,13615.92,5.28
database driven application and in the,13618.56,6.719
meantime we can verify that GitHub has,13621.2,6.3
the latest code you can see that it says,13625.279,4.2
Dynamic Pages for each job created one,13627.5,5.279
minute ago and we can go to render.com,13629.479,6.721
to verify that a recent deployment was,13632.779,4.741
done,13636.2,3.42
so let's see here a deployment was,13637.52,4.2
started,13639.62,4.08
okay,13641.72,4.08
Dynamic Pages for each job a deployment,13643.7,4.56
has been started and it might take maybe,13645.8,4.32
a minute or two so it is just,13648.26,4.2
downloading the cache right now just to,13650.12,5.88
quickly recap what we've done so far we,13652.46,6.18
set up a project,13656.0,4.319
by creating a copy of our existing,13658.64,3.719
GitHub project opened it on replit and,13660.319,3.841
also deployed it on render,13662.359,4.08
we also created a mySQL database on,13664.16,4.5
planet scale and connected to it using,13666.439,4.92
the MySQL workbench and,13668.66,4.079
then,13671.359,4.08
added some data into it created a table,13672.739,4.681
then we connected to it from replit,13675.439,4.861
using SQL Alchemy and then we used that,13677.42,4.92
to display the list of jobs from the,13680.3,3.599
cloud database,13682.34,3.36
onto the page,13683.899,3.96
then we created Dynamic pages to display,13685.7,4.86
each job role first we simply got,13687.859,5.101
information about a single job ID from,13690.56,4.259
the database and displayed that as Json,13692.96,4.979
then we showed that in an HTML format,13694.819,5.04
and then we used shared layout,13697.939,5.161
components to make the user interface,13699.859,6.0
look nicer and more consistent and we,13703.1,4.679
also made connections between the main,13705.859,5.701
page and the other page so now the now,13707.779,6.96
our site is now live okay looks like,13711.56,4.74
there was some change that did not get,13714.739,4.2
pushed so let's see looks like we have a,13716.3,4.38
bunch of,13718.939,4.321
things here that did not get added so,13720.68,4.86
I'm going to add these and add new,13723.26,3.9
templates,13725.54,5.1
and click commit and push and as soon as,13727.16,6.779
this gets deployed we should have all of,13730.64,5.58
these changes pushed to GitHub and,13733.939,6.061
deployed on jovencareers.com,13736.22,3.78
and careers.com,13741.979,6.781
will have a dynamic list of jobs,13744.2,6.6
loaded from the database every time we,13748.76,3.66
add a new job in the database it will,13750.8,3.78
automatically show up here,13752.42,4.979
we just have to reload the browser and,13754.58,6.48
we can go click apply and look at the,13757.399,5.701
actual job page as well,13761.06,4.56
but of course what's missing here is the,13763.1,4.379
actual application form,13765.62,4.5
so the actual application form is,13767.479,4.441
missing and we are going to add that,13770.12,2.76
next,13771.92,3.42
so let's go back here let's go into,13772.88,7.5
files and let us go into app.pi and see,13775.34,7.32
where we can add the application form,13780.38,5.34
so we want ideally the application form,13782.66,6.48
to show up right below here somewhere in,13785.72,6.3
fact if we go back into the wireframes,13789.14,6.2
that we had created early on,13792.02,3.32
you can see here that on the job page we,13797.42,4.68
have this information about the job and,13800.42,4.2
here we have the application form so we,13802.1,4.2
want the application form to show up,13804.62,4.44
right below somewhere here,13806.3,5.519
so how do we make that happen we have to,13809.06,6.0
make some change Inside Job page.html,13811.819,5.821
so I'm going to go into templates and I,13815.06,5.58
am going to first create a new template,13817.64,6.74
called application dot application form,13820.64,6.66
application underscoreform.html,13824.38,5.5
and I'm going to go into jobpage.html,13827.3,6.86
and include it so first let me just put,13829.88,4.28
to do,13834.2,4.739
application form goes here,13835.7,5.46
and let me close this for a moment let,13838.939,3.721
me also,13841.16,4.02
put this away to the side so application,13842.66,4.079
form goes here,13845.18,3.599
and let me import that inside,13846.739,4.021
jobpage.html,13848.779,4.5
so let me import,13850.76,4.32
inside the container,13853.279,4.761
let us import,13855.08,2.96
application,13859.58,4.68
form.html,13861.26,3.0
okay and let's go back here let's reload,13865.939,5.721
this page,13869.239,2.421
okay there seems to be an error,13872.06,3.679
oh it should be called include,13878.66,7.22
yep and let's reload that,13881.54,4.34
okay so now we have here to do,13886.58,3.6
application form goes here and now we,13888.62,3.54
can start creating the form,13890.18,7.02
so to create forms in HTML there is a,13892.16,7.38
special tag called form so first let's,13897.2,6.3
just give this a title a application,13899.54,7.02
form and there is a stack called form,13903.5,5.88
and that's how you create a form in HTML,13906.56,6.24
and within the form we want some inputs,13909.38,6.54
so there's a tag called input and the,13912.8,4.8
most and you have to give each input a,13915.92,4.319
type so the most common type is text and,13917.6,4.2
you have to give each input a name so,13920.239,3.66
let's just call this full underscore,13921.8,3.019
name,13923.899,4.08
and that's it,13924.819,5.681
and that should show an input box,13927.979,5.401
and let's just save that and let's see,13930.5,5.7
what that gave us here,13933.38,5.28
okay so now we have this input box but,13936.2,4.079
we probably want some kind of a label,13938.66,4.44
here so we can go in here and we can,13940.279,4.441
actually give it a label so we can say,13943.1,3.9
label,13944.72,4.62
full name,13947.0,4.08
and we can also show,13949.34,4.019
some sort of a placeholder here so we,13951.08,4.02
can type placeholder and attribute,13953.359,4.681
placeholder and say,13955.1,6.6
Bruce Wayne again this is something that,13958.04,5.76
if you take a basic the even the most,13961.7,4.44
basic HTML tutorial they will show you,13963.8,5.58
exactly this right so,13966.14,5.099
now you have,13969.38,4.019
full name Bruce Wayne I probably want,13971.239,4.561
this on the next line so I am just going,13973.399,5.04
to put a br here so BR is used to create,13975.8,5.22
a new line so these are all common HTML,13978.439,4.38
tags that you can look up how to add a,13981.02,3.9
new line in HTML okay so now we have,13982.819,5.281
full name Bruce Wayne that's nice and of,13984.92,4.439
course this is not the actual field,13988.1,3.0
information this is just a placeholder,13989.359,3.321
and as you start typing it will go away,13991.1,3.96
and what are the things we want for an,13992.68,4.599
application so let's go back here let's,13995.06,6.14
check the design that we had,13997.279,7.321
xcaliddraw.com okay so we want name,14001.2,5.739
email LinkedIn,14004.6,4.379
education work experience and resume,14006.939,4.621
link and education work experience,14008.979,4.981
should allow multiple lines of text and,14011.56,3.839
then resume link should be a URL,14013.96,3.54
LinkedIn should be a URL so let's come,14015.399,4.08
back and let's start putting these,14017.5,6.359
things in so let's put label,14019.479,4.38
email,14025.06,4.5
and we can put in,14027.34,4.2
put,14029.56,4.08
type equals,14031.54,5.939
text name equals email and this name is,14033.64,5.639
going to be important later you're going,14037.479,3.84
to see how,14039.279,5.221
Bruce wayne.com,14041.319,7.681
and let's create a again another label,14044.5,8.52
and this time we have the LinkedIn,14049.0,8.22
and let's see input type equals text,14053.02,6.68
name equals email,14057.22,6.2
placeholder equals,14059.7,3.72
LinkedIn let's call it LinkedIn URL,14064.779,4.16
LinkedIn dot in linkedin.com in slash,14070.479,7.681
Bruce Wayne okay so it's nice to provide,14074.279,6.16
hints as to what you expect to see in,14078.16,3.3
the form,14080.439,3.601
that makes it easier for the people,14081.46,4.38
filling the form and I think we might,14084.04,4.38
need maybe we can just put this inside a,14085.84,4.979
div each one,14088.42,7.64
so that they show up separately,14090.819,5.241
and use a br here,14097.3,3.5
so div simply creates a box around,14103.3,4.5
things and then two things don't show up,14105.16,4.26
on the same line if they are in,14107.8,3.12
different divs,14109.42,4.38
so let's check that,14110.92,5.279
okay close enough,14113.8,5.76
let's put BR here as well so before we,14116.199,5.101
add the other inputs,14119.56,3.719
let's add a submit button,14121.3,4.2
to the form so now we have full name,14123.279,4.08
email LinkedIn URL all these are there,14125.5,3.72
let's add a submit button so we can add,14127.359,4.681
a submit button simply by,14129.22,6.54
saying input type equals submit,14132.04,6.779
and that's it and we can also say name,14135.76,5.16
equals submit if you want,14138.819,4.561
but this is all we need to add a submit,14140.92,4.559
button,14143.38,4.2
great so now we have full name email,14145.479,4.38
LinkedIn URL submit maybe we need some,14147.58,6.06
margins here so let me just do class,14149.859,6.481
MB,14153.64,7.219
2 and let's put that all over,14156.34,4.519
and let's check that one more time,14164.92,3.62
okay our form is looking nice so we have,14168.699,5.04
Apple full name email LinkedIn URL and,14170.739,5.341
we can click submit but nothing happens,14173.739,3.96
when we click submit you can see it just,14176.08,3.06
reloads the page,14177.699,2.7
so,14179.14,3.839
well actually something does happen,14180.399,4.92
if you see here what has happened here,14182.979,5.401
is it has reloaded the page but it has,14185.319,5.341
added some information in the URL so,14188.38,4.5
looks like the names of the inputs got,14190.66,4.68
picked up and something is supposed to,14192.88,4.5
show up here which is not showing up yet,14195.34,3.96
because we have not filled the form,14197.38,5.16
so let's come back and let's do one,14199.3,5.28
thing first let's fix this this should,14202.54,4.14
be called LinkedIn,14204.58,6.0
URL and let's add an action to the form,14206.68,7.559
so an action lets us specify where the,14210.58,6.18
data in the form is supposed to be sent,14214.239,5.281
so when we click submit we want this,14216.76,5.04
information to be sent to job,14219.52,3.719
and,14221.8,4.399
remember this is being used inside job,14223.239,5.341
page.html and inside job page we have,14226.199,5.2
this job object and is in this job,14228.58,5.399
object we have,14231.399,5.88
ID so I can go back here into nav sorry,14233.979,6.3
into application form and I can say that,14237.279,5.341
I want this to be sent,14240.279,5.7
into job ID,14242.62,7.26
slash apply okay so we don't have a,14245.979,5.641
Handler for this route yet but this is,14249.88,3.059
where we want this information to be,14251.62,5.279
sent so now if I just,14252.939,6.96
reload the page,14256.899,5.221
and then fill some information let's say,14259.899,4.741
our caution is our caution is at,14262.12,4.68
joven.ai,14264.64,4.44
and let me leave this blank and I click,14266.8,3.5
submit,14269.08,3.48
observe the URL,14270.3,5.74
so now the URL has gone to,14272.56,7.7
German careers website V2 repel.com,14276.04,6.96
apply and then we have a question mark,14280.26,5.679
and then we have full name equals Akash,14283.0,5.46
plus n plus s and then email equals,14285.939,4.081
something and then LinkedIn equals,14288.46,3.3
something so this data got encoded in,14290.02,4.44
some format and added to the URL,14291.76,5.46
but of course we don't have any routes,14294.46,4.56
in our flask application to handle them,14297.22,3.96
so that's why it says not found over,14299.02,2.94
here,14301.18,3.48
but that's where we can now go ahead and,14301.96,3.96
we can,14304.66,4.5
handle this by creating a new route,14305.92,6.42
so let's come in here and let's say app,14309.16,5.9
dot route,14312.34,2.72
and let's do slash job and slash ID so,14318.58,5.52
now,14322.54,4.02
we have the ID here,14324.1,5.04
and then slash apply,14326.56,5.94
yeah so slash job slash ID slash apply,14329.14,5.58
then,14332.5,4.979
let's call this apply to job and once,14334.72,4.679
again it's going to get the ID so it's,14337.479,4.021
going to match slash job slash one slash,14339.399,4.5
apply slash job slash two slash apply so,14341.5,4.979
anything that has slash job slash some,14343.899,4.92
ID slash apply this is only going to,14346.479,4.081
match slash job slash one two three,14348.819,3.781
that's not going to match job slash one,14350.56,3.78
slash apply okay,14352.6,5.639
so now we have this information here,14354.34,6.059
about the ID,14358.239,4.561
and from this ID we can get the job if,14360.399,4.621
we want but how do we get all this,14362.8,3.66
information that is there after this,14365.02,2.94
question mark so you can see there is,14366.46,2.7
all this information after the question,14367.96,2.16
mark,14369.16,3.119
a question mark full name equals Akash,14370.12,4.44
NS and so on the way to get that,14372.279,5.881
information is using,14374.56,5.94
the request,14378.16,4.98
variable from flask so we can come in,14380.5,4.38
here and we can say,14383.14,6.839
data equals request Dot args okay and,14384.88,8.84
for a moment let's just return,14389.979,3.741
Json fi,14394.3,3.38
data,14398.439,3.601
and let's see what that does so we are,14399.939,4.081
getting request.args and request is,14402.04,3.6
imported from flask,14404.02,4.5
and then we just say jsonify data so,14405.64,4.2
we're just taking whatever is there in,14408.52,3.179
request.arcs and converting it into Json,14409.84,4.32
let's go back and submit the form once,14411.699,5.04
again so we have akashness email,14414.16,4.8
akashness at jobin.ai and let's click,14416.739,4.021
submit,14418.96,5.88
and now when we send this data to the,14420.76,6.059
apply route,14424.84,4.26
okay yeah when we send this data to the,14426.819,5.281
apply route you can see that now all,14429.1,4.379
this information which was there in the,14432.1,5.04
URL got read into this variable data and,14433.479,6.061
then it got converted into Json so now,14437.14,4.98
here we have email full name LinkedIn,14439.54,4.56
and submit we probably don't want to,14442.12,3.779
submit so I can go back here and remove,14444.1,3.48
the submit remove the name for the,14445.899,5.761
submit so this will not get a name,14447.58,6.06
and now if I reload this page you'll see,14451.66,3.18
that it,14453.64,3.48
let's see if I click submit once again,14454.84,5.479
from this page,14457.12,3.199
now it is only showing us email full,14465.76,4.5
name and Linkedin URL,14468.22,6.179
great so that's good now we have some,14470.26,5.219
data,14474.399,4.621
that is filled in from one page and it,14475.479,5.701
is sent into another page,14479.02,4.98
and here inside this page inside the,14481.18,5.759
page inside the route job slash ID slash,14484.0,6.0
apply we can do some things we can store,14486.939,6.361
this in the DB,14490.0,7.14
and we can maybe also maybe display an,14493.3,6.439
acknowledgment,14497.14,2.599
and maybe we can also send an email so,14500.68,5.04
we can do all sorts of things with this,14503.859,3.0
information,14505.72,5.4
now remember our job listing,14506.859,6.301
our application form has a bunch of,14511.12,4.26
fields so it also has education and work,14513.16,4.98
experience and resume link and putting,14515.38,4.979
all that information in the URL can make,14518.14,5.16
the URL too long and also just slow,14520.359,5.101
things down a little bit so there is,14523.3,4.74
another way you can submit forms one way,14525.46,5.64
to submit forms is using sending data to,14528.04,5.279
a new route in the URL,14531.1,4.2
another way to submit from or another,14533.319,4.38
method to submit forms is something,14535.3,5.46
called post so here what you can do is,14537.699,7.521
you can say method equals post,14540.76,4.46
and now,14546.46,4.8
if I just go back here,14548.92,5.34
and reload this page,14551.26,6.8
and let's do this again,14554.26,3.8
and click submit,14559.96,4.92
so now you can see that we get an error,14562.12,4.44
first of all saying that this method is,14564.88,4.439
not allowed on this URL and second there,14566.56,5.52
is nothing in the URL the first name,14569.319,4.741
last name Etc don't show up in the URL,14572.08,4.08
anymore you can take a closer look here,14574.06,4.86
it just says slash job slash apply so,14576.16,4.56
when you are submitting using the post,14578.92,4.92
method then you need to process,14580.72,5.28
information using the post method tool,14583.84,3.96
so you can go in here and you can say,14586.0,5.279
methods equals post,14587.8,6.5
so now we have the form application,14591.279,6.42
form.html which uses the post method,14594.3,6.399
and then we have the route slash job,14597.699,5.401
slash ID apply which,14600.699,5.461
also expects the post method so it,14603.1,5.46
expects some data to be posted by the,14606.16,5.88
browser and not sent in a URL so now if,14608.56,6.78
I go back once again and click submit,14612.04,4.62
once again,14615.34,3.84
you can see now that nothing was sent in,14616.66,5.279
the URL and nothing is getting displayed,14619.18,5.58
here that's because now when you post,14621.939,4.401
data the data is no longer in,14624.76,3.84
request.arcs request.arcs contains,14626.34,4.72
information from the URL when you post,14628.6,5.52
the data is present in request.form okay,14631.06,6.839
so now I'm gonna go back one last time,14634.12,7.02
and click submit once again and this,14637.899,4.321
time,14641.14,3.54
you can see when we clicked submit that,14642.22,4.62
data was posted,14644.68,4.92
to this URL slash job slash three slash,14646.84,4.859
apply so nothing in the URL but the data,14649.6,4.56
was posted it was sent by the browser,14651.699,5.58
along with the request to this URL and,14654.16,5.159
now that data was accessed using,14657.279,5.521
request.form and finally that data was,14659.319,6.721
displayed here as email full name and,14662.8,5.519
Linkedin URL as Json,14666.04,5.159
okay so let's now just go ahead and add,14668.319,4.62
the other form Fields as well so I'm,14671.199,2.881
just going to add in the other form,14672.939,3.241
field so we have LinkedIn URL then we,14674.08,3.06
have,14676.18,2.46
I believe,14677.14,3.78
work education work experience and,14678.64,4.92
resume URL so I'm going to create one,14680.92,4.559
div,14683.56,5.04
and let's put in a label here,14685.479,4.621
education,14688.6,4.44
and let's put in an input here okay so,14690.1,4.98
now we want a multi-line input and,14693.04,3.779
there's a special tag for multi-layer,14695.08,3.84
input called text area so let's call,14696.819,4.641
that text area let's give it the name,14698.92,6.899
education and that is going to be a,14701.46,7.08
multi-line input,14705.819,2.721
and I think you have to close it like,14711.58,3.92
this,14713.319,2.181
so again something that can be looked up,14717.52,4.56
easily what is a multi-line input how to,14719.56,5.04
create a multi-line input in HTML,14722.08,6.5
education then we have work experience,14724.6,3.98
and then we have text area again,14730.779,4.5
name is,14733.3,3.54
work,14735.279,4.521
experience,14736.84,2.96
great and finally we have a resume URL,14743.62,5.22
I'm just going to copy this and paste,14746.439,3.42
this in here,14748.84,3.42
and let's change this to,14749.859,5.161
resume URL and the placeholder let's,14752.26,6.139
just remove the placeholder here,14755.02,3.379
and let's just call this,14758.979,5.101
resume URL,14761.1,5.08
okay,14764.08,5.34
let's add back this class here class mb2,14766.18,5.88
everywhere,14769.42,5.76
so now our form is largely complete we,14772.06,4.44
have,14775.18,3.599
if we go back here and reload the page,14776.5,5.1
we should see all the fields okay we,14778.779,4.741
might need to just add,14781.6,5.06
br's here,14783.52,3.14
so now we have full name email LinkedIn,14794.14,5.219
URL education work experience resume URL,14796.66,6.48
and we can click submit that's nice and,14799.359,5.58
maybe these can be a little bigger so,14803.14,4.5
we'll handle that styling later but at,14804.939,4.38
least we have all the fields now and I,14807.64,3.179
can just put in information into some of,14809.319,3.741
these,14810.819,2.241
and let's just put some sample,14820.0,3.66
information here,14822.1,3.42
and let's click submit,14823.66,3.96
and all of that gets posted and nothing,14825.52,4.379
is sent in the URL so it's nice and,14827.62,4.739
short but all the information is sent,14829.899,3.901
into,14832.359,2.88
flask,14833.8,3.12
and of course now we can come back into,14835.239,4.021
flask and we can probably actually,14836.92,5.42
render this information properly so,14839.26,6.42
let's say application,14842.34,7.12
let's create a file a new file here,14845.68,7.019
and let's call it application,14849.46,7.979
submitted or just application.html,14852.699,4.74
let's call it application submitted dot,14857.68,4.44
HTML,14859.72,5.34
and in application submitted.html and,14862.12,4.14
this is the template that we're going to,14865.06,4.139
render from that route which handles the,14866.26,5.34
application so this needs to be an,14869.199,4.381
entire HTML page so once again I'm going,14871.6,4.139
to go to the job page I'm going to pick,14873.58,4.159
up doctype,14875.739,3.54
HTML,14877.739,4.561
let's put that,14879.279,3.021
and let's get HTML,14882.58,5.699
and let's get title,14885.399,5.821
application submitted let's just say,14888.279,4.561
that,14891.22,3.719
of course that should be inside head so,14892.84,5.18
let's put that inside head,14894.939,3.081
and let's put body and in the body let's,14898.6,5.219
start just showing that information so,14901.6,4.5
H4,14903.819,4.88
full name,14906.1,2.599
maybe just a div,14909.76,6.24
and let's look for a variable called,14913.3,4.5
application and from the application,14916.0,3.239
let's get,14917.8,4.979
full underscore name and maybe let's do,14919.239,5.341
one more so,14922.779,4.2
let's get,14924.58,7.26
email and let's print the email here,14926.979,6.061
okay,14931.84,3.84
and now let's go back into app.pi and,14933.04,6.3
let's render that so now we are saying,14935.68,6.299
instead of jsonify the data we want to,14939.34,5.479
say render,14941.979,2.84
template,14946.0,4.68
application,14947.92,5.399
submitted.html,14950.68,7.08
and we want to pass application as the,14953.319,7.38
data that was received,14957.76,6.0
so we are taking the form data we are,14960.699,5.101
taking that dictionary that we get from,14963.76,3.599
the form data and we are passing it with,14965.8,3.42
the name application,14967.359,5.04
so let's reload okay reloading does not,14969.22,5.7
work when you're posting information so,14972.399,5.58
let's just post again,14974.92,5.76
okay application submitted.html template,14977.979,5.581
not from there's a typo so let's call,14980.68,6.96
the application let's fix that and let's,14983.56,7.139
reload and let's post again,14987.64,6.559
okay so now you have full,14990.699,6.421
name.ai so that's nice how about we,14994.199,5.261
finish this up we put in all the other,14997.12,5.04
fields here as well so application,14999.46,5.16
submitted full name,15002.16,5.1
and then we have email and then we have,15004.62,5.659
LinkedIn URL,15007.26,3.019
so let's put LinkedIn URL here,15011.939,3.741
then,15017.34,4.2
we have,15019.68,4.38
work experience education,15021.54,4.439
and resume URL,15024.06,4.5
so let's fix that,15025.979,5.781
resume URL,15028.56,3.2
resume URL and then we have,15031.859,6.981
work experience,15035.58,3.26
education,15046.859,2.84
education all right so,15053.52,7.58
we'll have to go back and submit again,15057.06,4.04
now we have the full name email LinkedIn,15061.979,4.681
URL education work experience resume URL,15064.38,4.019
all the information is there but,15066.66,4.02
wouldn't it be nice to have the same,15068.399,4.08
layout that we had on the previous page,15070.68,2.58
here,15072.479,2.821
so it would be nice to have the same,15073.26,3.9
layout and now you can probably guess,15075.3,4.679
how easy it is to do that if I just go,15077.16,5.52
into job page.html I can probably bring,15079.979,5.76
over include bootstrap.html here into,15082.68,4.86
application submitted,15085.739,4.261
so the bootstrap Styles will come in,15087.54,5.76
and then I can go into job page.html and,15090.0,5.46
bring in the nav and the banner,15093.3,5.059
let's do that,15095.46,2.899
and let's go into job page.html and,15098.399,5.941
bring in the footer as well let's do,15101.399,5.04
that,15104.34,3.059
thank you,15106.439,4.92
and of course let's put all this into a,15107.399,7.08
container so div,15111.359,6.12
class equals actually how about we just,15114.479,5.401
copy that over as well so let's go to,15117.479,3.96
job page,15119.88,6.599
and let's grab the this piece,15121.439,8.721
and let's go back into,15126.479,3.681
this and put all of the code inside a,15130.5,7.04
container,15135.12,2.42
so let's take all that and then just,15138.0,4.5
give it just a quick indentation so that,15139.92,4.26
it lines up properly,15142.5,4.319
and maybe let's also add a,15144.18,7.58
nice confirmation here that,15146.819,4.941
your application has been submitted,15152.76,6.54
okay,15157.8,2.54
so,15159.3,7.26
just like that now if we click submit,15160.34,8.62
you can see that we've transformed this,15166.56,4.44
page in,15168.96,4.5
just a few just less than a minute now,15171.0,5.1
it is the exact it we went from this to,15173.46,4.26
this and of course there is some work to,15176.1,3.12
be done here it needs it's not as nice,15177.72,3.54
as it can be so we're going to fix that,15179.22,4.32
in a second but what we can also put,15181.26,5.7
here is maybe the job name itself so if,15183.54,6.54
I go back in app dot pi and I get the,15186.96,6.0
job information so I say job equals load,15190.08,5.88
job from DB ID,15192.96,6.68
and just provide,15195.96,3.68
job equals job,15200.1,5.099
then I have information about the job,15203.16,4.38
here so let me go in here and let me say,15205.199,5.401
your application for,15207.54,4.319
job,15210.6,3.98
title,15211.859,2.721
for the role of,15215.88,6.68
so and so,15219.779,2.781
at Jovian has been submitted,15222.84,5.58
and let's maybe fix,15225.72,5.04
some of this,15228.42,4.979
class,15230.76,5.639
MB,15233.399,3.0
0 and maybe let's use here,15237.479,6.181
class and before so just adding space,15241.319,5.16
below and not above the,15243.66,5.039
code so let's again submit that once,15246.479,4.34
again,15248.699,2.12
and this is what it looks like maybe we,15251.399,3.901
don't even need headers so maybe we can,15253.56,3.0
just use,15255.3,3.179
bold text here,15256.56,5.06
and that should be fine,15258.479,3.141
and this can just be mb2 so let's just,15263.399,5.84
make this bold text,15266.279,2.96
and let's grab that class,15277.68,3.5
okay let's take another look,15304.739,4.46
yep so your application for the role of,15311.58,3.899
front-end developer at jobin has been,15313.68,3.84
submitted and we have the full name,15315.479,3.901
email LinkedIn URL education work,15317.52,3.24
experience resume URL so whatever,15319.38,3.0
information you've provided all of that,15320.76,4.979
is going to get,15322.38,5.519
displayed here right and maybe we can,15325.739,5.421
make this bold instead of,15327.899,3.261
putting it in quotations,15332.1,4.379
but that's pretty much it that's all we,15334.08,5.04
need to do and now,15336.479,4.5
so that's one thing we have displayed an,15339.12,4.199
acknowledgment then we also want to,15340.979,4.321
store this in the DB as you can guess,15343.319,3.54
that is going to be fairly,15345.3,4.5
straightforward as well so I can very,15346.859,5.34
simply just go into,15349.8,5.34
the database dot pi and here I can,15352.199,5.521
create a new,15355.14,5.179
function,15357.72,2.599
add application to DB and that's going,15360.54,6.359
to take a job ID because each,15364.859,4.021
application should ideally be connected,15366.899,4.201
to a job ID and it's going to take the,15368.88,4.439
application information and it's going,15371.1,5.339
to put that into a table but we will,15373.319,4.801
need to create a table first,15376.439,4.201
so let's create a table I have some code,15378.12,4.859
here already for creating a table called,15380.64,5.94
applications so let me copy this,15382.979,6.901
and let me come into MySQL workbench and,15386.58,4.56
paste it here,15389.88,3.359
so we are saying,15391.14,4.2
let's make it a little simpler so we are,15393.239,4.021
saying create table applications so,15395.34,3.42
we're going to create a new table called,15397.26,4.32
applications and the applications table,15398.76,4.86
is going to have an ID,15401.58,3.42
which is going to be the unique,15403.62,3.42
application ID it is going to be not,15405.0,4.26
null Auto increment and it is also going,15407.04,3.96
to be the primary key,15409.26,3.599
then each application is going to be,15411.0,3.66
associated with a job so it's also going,15412.859,3.84
to have a job ID so that's what this is,15414.66,2.819
for,15416.699,2.761
and each application will have a full,15417.479,4.26
name it have an email it will have a,15419.46,5.399
LinkedIn URL education work experience a,15421.739,5.281
resume URL all of that,15424.859,5.161
and let's just create that table,15427.02,5.339
and that table has been created so we,15430.02,5.48
can see show tables,15432.359,3.141
and you can see here that we have,15435.6,4.98
applications table and a jobs table and,15437.3,5.86
let's check show select,15440.58,6.359
star from applications,15443.16,6.3
and there is nothing inside applications,15446.939,5.401
but now we are going to write but now we,15449.46,4.439
are going to write the code to put,15452.34,3.3
things into applications so once again,15453.899,6.3
we say engine dot connect as con,15455.64,7.2
and then we say,15460.199,4.861
let me first create the query so query,15462.84,4.979
will be text,15465.06,4.5
select no,15467.819,4.021
insert,15469.56,6.06
into applications,15471.84,3.78
and we need to give it the list of,15475.699,5.5
columns that we're going to insert so ID,15478.199,4.74
is going to be filled automatically so,15481.199,3.66
we're going to insert job ID full name,15482.939,3.901
email LinkedIn URL education work,15484.859,5.161
experience and resume URL so let's put,15486.84,5.34
that on the next line Maybe,15490.02,3.9
and the way to put it on the next line,15492.18,3.9
is or let's just put it on the same line,15493.92,3.96
that's okay so we're going to insert a,15496.08,4.739
job ID we are going to provide a full,15497.88,6.359
name we are going to provide,15500.819,5.66
email we're going to provide LinkedIn,15504.239,4.681
URL we're going to provide education,15506.479,5.5
we're going to provide experience and we,15508.92,4.74
are going to provide,15511.979,4.5
resume URL,15513.66,4.92
so insert into applications first we,15516.479,4.321
provide the list of,15518.58,4.14
columns we are going to specify and then,15520.8,4.439
we say values again this is a Syntax for,15522.72,4.8
insert and then here we provide the,15525.239,4.021
values that we want to insert,15527.52,5.4
now we can't put all this directly so,15529.26,6.0
basically what we're going to do is have,15532.92,3.96
some variable names here and we're going,15535.26,3.9
to pass those variables later,15536.88,4.92
so let me put job underscore ID so,15539.16,4.38
that's going to become a variable name,15541.8,4.08
colon full underscore name that is going,15543.54,3.899
to become a variable name,15545.88,3.72
then colon email that is going to become,15547.439,4.141
a variable Name colon,15549.6,4.74
LinkedIn URL that is going to become a,15551.58,4.92
variable Name colon education that is,15554.34,4.28
going to become a variable Name colon,15556.5,4.38
experience that is going to become a,15558.62,4.38
variable name and colon resume,15560.88,4.019
underscore URL and that's going to,15563.0,3.819
become a variable name too,15564.899,3.901
so now that's the query that's basically,15566.819,3.96
what we are going to put in so then we,15568.8,4.439
can say con dot execute and we're not,15570.779,4.261
interested in the result here we just,15573.239,6.0
wanted to succeed so con.execute query,15575.04,5.819
and let's start putting in the,15579.239,4.2
information job underscore ID which will,15580.859,4.681
replace this value is going to Simply Be,15583.439,4.861
job underscore ID that is coming here,15585.54,6.48
so let's put that there then we have the,15588.3,6.059
full underscore name that is simply,15592.02,4.56
going to be the application which is,15594.359,4.561
going to be passed as a dictionary so,15596.58,3.96
what we're going to do is we are going,15598.92,4.859
to take this dictionary that is,15600.54,6.3
sent in request.form and we're going to,15603.779,5.221
pass it to this,15606.84,5.46
function add application to DB so from,15609.0,4.979
the app or let's just call it data just,15612.3,2.58
to,15613.979,4.141
keep it shorter so full name is simply,15614.88,6.96
going to be the full name from the data,15618.12,7.92
and similarly we will do this for,15621.84,6.78
a bunch of other,15626.04,4.56
things so,15628.62,3.359
the,15630.6,3.66
email,15631.979,4.561
is simply going to be the email from the,15634.26,4.639
data,15636.54,2.359
then the education,15641.239,5.861
is simply going to be the education from,15645.359,4.281
the data,15647.1,2.54
finally we have work experience,15654.359,3.801
is going to be work,15658.979,4.201
experience,15661.26,5.82
and we have resume URL,15663.18,6.92
that's going to be,15667.08,3.02
the resume URL from the data okay and we,15670.739,6.181
just want to execute this and that's it,15674.699,6.0
now what do we do we go into app.pi and,15676.92,6.26
we import,15680.699,2.481
what is it called,15685.14,5.94
add application to DB so add,15687.779,8.04
application to DB we import it and we,15691.08,8.52
simply call add application to DB,15695.819,6.061
inside app.pi,15699.6,4.799
after getting the data from the form we,15701.88,4.8
say add application to DB we give it the,15704.399,5.101
job ID or simply the ID which is a job,15706.68,5.7
ID and we give it the data,15709.5,5.22
so this ID is going to populate the job,15712.38,4.68
ID column you can see add application to,15714.72,4.019
DB does that,15717.06,3.54
the first argument is used to populate,15718.739,3.54
job ID and then the rest of the,15720.6,3.179
arguments or the data is used to,15722.279,4.141
populate the rest of the columns,15723.779,5.521
okay I think that should do it so this,15726.42,4.38
is going to store the data into the,15729.3,5.639
database so let's save it and let's let,15730.8,6.62
that run,15734.939,2.481
looks like it's running,15737.819,3.721
So This Is The Moment of Truth this is,15739.56,4.74
what we've been building towards,15741.54,5.52
so let's see Akash NS akashness at,15744.3,4.439
joven.ai I'm going to put in a good,15747.06,3.48
value here this time because it's,15748.739,4.861
probably going to go into the database,15750.54,7.739
and education let's see CSC IIT,15753.6,7.2
Bombay work experience,15758.279,4.381
software,15760.8,3.96
engineer Twitter,15762.66,4.739
resume URL I'm not going to put anything,15764.76,4.74
in there right now and let's click,15767.399,4.321
submit,15769.5,5.16
let's see if this works,15771.72,5.4
okay a value is required for the bind,15774.66,4.619
parameter LinkedIn URL so looks like we,15777.12,4.5
made a mistake so this is exactly what,15779.279,3.601
happens you have to go in you have to,15781.62,4.319
fix things let's get LinkedIn URL in,15782.88,5.24
here,15785.939,2.181
and let's go back,15794.04,4.739
the data still there fresh let's click,15796.439,4.701
submit,15798.779,2.361
what else now,15803.279,2.901
a value is required for experience looks,15806.34,4.5
like we did not put in experience oh,15808.56,5.759
it's just called experience is it,15810.84,6.599
let's see oh this was,15814.319,4.801
okay this is this should be called work,15817.439,6.181
experience and that should do it,15819.12,7.64
let's submit now,15823.62,3.14
unknown column experience in field list,15833.1,4.339
okay this should be called work,15838.68,4.28
experience as well,15840.12,2.84
perfect looks like this went through so,15849.239,3.781
your application for the role of,15851.76,3.12
front-end developer Joven has been,15853.02,5.1
submitted full name email LinkedIn URL,15854.88,6.479
education work experience resume URL and,15858.12,6.119
let's go into this and select start from,15861.359,5.42
applications,15864.239,2.54
and looks like this information is here,15868.56,3.12
so,15870.72,3.719
ID is one the job ID is three and you,15871.68,4.86
can see here job ID3 is front-end,15874.439,3.3
developer,15876.54,4.02
and the email is akashness at jobin.ai,15877.739,5.641
the LinkedIn URL is as provided,15880.56,5.7
education work experience and resume URL,15883.38,4.559
perfect and you can try making another,15886.26,3.3
application and that will show up as,15887.939,3.181
well so,15889.56,4.139
that's something that can be done easily,15891.12,5.159
so let's take this and let's just Commit,15893.699,5.101
This and let's then revise everything,15896.279,6.361
that we've done today so,15898.8,3.84
let's see let me add all of these,15903.0,4.399
and let's say,15907.8,5.399
store application in database,15909.54,7.1
and let me commit in push,15913.199,3.441
and with that we have,15917.22,5.46
added a form to collect applications on,15920.34,4.2
the job Details page created a flask,15922.68,3.24
route to handle application form,15924.54,3.72
submissions created a table to Store,15925.92,4.439
applications in the cloud database and,15928.26,3.84
stored the submitted applications and,15930.359,4.201
shown an acknowledgment so we have this,15932.1,3.719
nice,15934.56,5.06
let me just change that to,15935.819,3.801
and,15940.199,2.66
so we have this nice message that page,15942.96,4.979
that shows up informing the person that,15945.779,4.261
your application for the specific role,15947.939,4.26
has been submitted and remember you can,15950.04,4.439
now go into any role so you can go on,15952.199,4.5
Jovian you can go into the role of data,15954.479,4.26
scientists for example and you can,15956.699,5.101
submit an application here,15958.739,5.16
and you can click submit and that's,15961.8,4.019
going to submit for that specific role,15963.899,3.901
right all of those applications are,15965.819,5.101
tracked in the same table but you can,15967.8,6.54
always filter and figure out,15970.92,6.359
which job ID you want to look at the,15974.34,5.66
applications for,15977.279,2.721
so that's it that's all we're going to,15980.939,3.84
do today now you can make some,15982.859,3.84
enhancements here as well you can make,15984.779,3.12
some functional and aesthetic,15986.699,3.061
improvements you can try to validate the,15987.899,3.84
application form responses before,15989.76,4.679
submission so you can Mark some of these,15991.739,5.341
fields as required and you can also,15994.439,4.201
maybe put in,15997.08,3.84
other information like URL so you can,15998.64,5.0
say HTML form validations,16000.92,6.5
and search that,16003.64,3.78
and let's see search for,16007.58,4.68
mdn,16010.34,4.62
client-side form validation,16012.26,4.62
and here you can see that there are many,16014.96,5.04
ways to use form validation,16016.88,4.62
one thing you can do is you can say,16020.0,3.239
something is required,16021.5,3.899
and then it won't allow submission then,16023.239,4.281
you can also specify certain patterns,16025.399,5.221
and you can also specify specific input,16027.52,6.4
types so if you search for HTML input,16030.62,5.279
types,16033.92,3.779
you can see that there are all these,16035.899,4.08
input types and some of these are like,16037.699,5.101
URL and email so if I just quickly go,16039.979,6.661
back here and change the form so go into,16042.8,7.559
Form application form.html and change,16046.64,6.96
the type here to email,16050.359,5.941
and Mark this is required,16053.6,5.219
and Mark this is required,16056.3,5.88
and change the type here to URL,16058.819,5.34
and maybe also change the type here to,16062.18,3.479
URL,16064.159,5.401
now if I go back here and I try to,16065.659,6.601
submit first if I try to submit empty,16069.56,6.08
it's gonna fail,16072.26,3.38
okay not yet,16076.58,3.02
I believe it just needed to reload a bit,16082.159,4.261
but yeah I think it should it should,16084.5,4.08
there is a way to ensure that it fails,16086.42,3.779
so maybe it's not doing that right just,16088.58,5.04
yet let me just reload and try again,16090.199,5.221
yeah you can see here it says please,16093.62,4.5
fill out this field and let's say I fill,16095.42,5.939
this out and now if I say submit now it,16098.12,4.92
says please fill out this field and,16101.359,3.84
let's say I don't put in an email here,16103.04,4.199
now it says please include an ad in the,16105.199,4.681
email address okay please enter the part,16107.239,4.681
following at,16109.88,5.939
so it will validate the email and let's,16111.92,5.819
say I try to put in something that's not,16115.819,7.261
a URL here it will validate that it says,16117.739,8.101
please enter a valid URL and similarly,16123.08,4.98
here as well please enter a valid URL,16125.84,3.78
right so you can leave this blank but,16128.06,4.56
you cannot enter invalid data so that's,16129.62,5.4
one form of validation that you can do,16132.62,4.92
I think we did that then another thing,16135.02,4.86
you can do is you can send an email to,16137.54,4.619
the administrator and to the candidate,16139.88,4.68
every time an application is submitted,16142.159,5.04
and sending emails can be done using,16144.56,5.4
email sending apis so there is one,16147.199,3.901
called,16149.96,3.239
mail,16151.1,4.92
jet you can try out,16153.199,4.74
so mailjet.com,16156.02,5.48
all you need to do here is,16157.939,7.26
you sign up and then it will give you an,16161.5,5.56
API key and you can just send emails,16165.199,3.481
using that API key,16167.06,4.08
so that's one way to send emails another,16168.68,3.84
thing that you can do is you can include,16171.14,4.44
a captcha because right now people can,16172.52,5.82
just use a selenium or some kind of a,16175.58,4.68
web scraper and keep submitting again,16178.34,4.139
and again the same form and,16180.26,4.439
overload your database and you probably,16182.479,3.781
don't want that and the way to avoid,16184.699,3.301
that is using those captures those,16186.26,3.179
things that ask you to select traffic,16188.0,4.439
signs and select boats and cars by,16189.439,4.26
showing boxes,16192.439,3.661
so one capture tool that you can use is,16193.699,6.861
called hcaptcha.com Edge captcha,16196.1,6.719
hcaptcha.com so,16200.56,6.82
what it gives you is this it basically,16202.819,6.601
whenever you try to select something and,16207.38,3.42
then you try to click I am a human,16209.42,4.62
you'll add this box and it will ask the,16210.8,4.979
user to First validate something like,16214.04,3.84
this so maybe selecting trains so here,16215.779,5.101
it select bus bus next train train let's,16217.88,5.04
say Get it wrong it's going to reject,16220.88,4.319
the form submission so this way people,16222.92,5.64
cannot try to spam you or fool you so,16225.199,4.561
that's something that you can look into,16228.56,2.82
sending emails is something that you can,16229.76,2.639
look into,16231.38,3.059
another thing you can try is to create,16232.399,4.141
an API to access individual job listings,16234.439,4.5
and individual applications by ID,16236.54,4.08
so doing individual job listings is,16238.939,4.561
actually pretty easy you can just go in,16240.62,5.72
here app dot pi and,16243.5,6.359
just add a route here at app,16246.34,5.68
dot route,16249.859,5.641
slash job slash okay slash API slash job,16252.02,5.82
slash ID,16255.5,6.42
and all you do here is Def should,16257.84,5.939
job Json,16261.92,5.519
which takes the ID and which just gets,16263.779,5.821
the job from the database,16267.439,5.161
and says return,16269.6,5.759
Json file,16272.6,4.44
job,16275.359,4.8
and just with that you can now go back,16277.04,5.96
and you can say,16280.159,2.841
slash API slash job slash three and just,16283.76,7.08
get the same job in Json format,16288.02,4.56
all right so similarly you can add,16290.84,3.96
another route for slash API slash,16292.58,3.98
application slash ID which can return,16294.8,4.559
data for a particular application and,16296.56,5.56
each application also had has an ID and,16299.359,5.34
do that or you can also have a API to,16302.12,4.5
just get the applications for a specific,16304.699,4.261
job so all sorts of things you can do,16306.62,5.22
now you have all that power so these are,16308.96,4.14
some functional and aesthetic,16311.84,2.96
improvements that we can make,16313.1,4.679
and then in terms of even going Beyond,16314.8,4.72
and sort of making this a full-fledged,16317.779,3.601
website you can create an admin login,16319.52,3.6
interface so that we don't have to,16321.38,3.54
directly interact with the database,16323.12,4.619
admins can log in and create and check,16324.92,5.279
submitted applications admins can add,16327.739,5.16
jobs admins can delete jobs admins can,16330.199,4.801
Mark applications as accepted rejected,16332.899,4.741
and users can also maybe login to check,16335.0,4.859
their application status so a lot of,16337.64,4.559
work can be done a lot of possibilities,16339.859,4.981
here so let's just Commit This one last,16342.199,4.141
time,16344.84,3.359
and,16346.34,4.5
what do we do we added an API,16348.199,5.46
so let's just add that API here and,16350.84,5.04
let's click commit and push,16353.659,4.62
and soon enough all of this is going to,16355.88,6.059
be available on jovencareers.com,16358.279,5.821
most of it already should be so here we,16361.939,5.701
have the jobs and here we have the job,16364.1,5.16
Details page,16367.64,3.48
and here we have an application form,16369.26,3.78
which,16371.12,3.659
soon enough we'll have the validations,16373.04,4.22
as well,16374.779,2.481
and here then we can submit and then we,16379.0,4.84
display the application,16382.22,4.559
and we also make that,16383.84,6.56
entry into the database,16386.779,3.621
there we go,16391.4,3.719
so yeah that's everything that we're,16392.9,5.94
going to look at today so quick recap we,16395.119,5.66
use the project from the previous,16398.84,5.221
tutorial made a copy of it opened it on,16400.779,5.801
replit and deployed it to render at,16404.061,5.699
jobin careers.com we set up a cloud,16406.58,5.58
mySQL database on planet scale,16409.76,5.099
we created a jobs table added data using,16412.16,5.459
the MySQL workbench we connected to the,16414.859,4.981
database from replit using SQL Alchemy,16417.619,4.861
we in fact created a database.pi file,16419.84,5.58
which has all of the database related,16422.48,5.161
logic it encapsulates,16425.42,4.98
then we connected to the database and,16427.641,4.379
displayed the list of jobs from the,16430.4,4.02
cloud database using SQL Alchemy we,16432.02,4.56
created Dynamic pages to display each,16434.42,3.48
job role,16436.58,4.561
each page each job got its own page we,16437.9,5.58
shared the layout Styles and navigations,16441.141,5.158
using bootstrap so all the pages look,16443.48,5.459
nice and professional and consistent and,16446.299,4.681
we consistently deployed all these,16448.939,4.5
changes to GitHub and render and we also,16450.98,4.5
made sure that we are not exposing our,16453.439,4.02
database password on GitHub so that's,16455.48,5.1
why we used secrets on replit and also,16457.459,5.102
on render then we added a form to,16460.58,3.959
collect applications on the job Details,16462.561,4.798
page and then we created created a flask,16464.539,4.441
route to handle the application form,16467.359,4.5
submissions then we created a table to,16468.98,4.5
store the applications in the cloud,16471.859,4.141
database finally we stored those,16473.48,4.92
submitted applications and showed an,16476.0,5.279
acknowledgment and then we also,16478.4,4.979
validated the application form responses,16481.279,4.141
before submission and there are few,16483.379,4.682
things that given a couple more hours we,16485.42,4.799
should be able to also incorporate to,16488.061,4.378
make our site even more robust,16490.219,5.521
so just like that in our in a matter of,16492.439,5.702
two tutorials six or seven hours of work,16495.74,5.401
we have gone from this this concept this,16498.141,6.0
idea of a jovian couriers website and,16501.141,5.218
Details page applications and,16504.141,4.019
acknowledgment page so we've gone from,16506.359,5.221
there this to this actual real,16508.16,5.279
functional website that we can actually,16511.58,3.9
use and it's completely functional,16513.439,4.081
there's nothing here that is stopping us,16515.48,5.399
from using it actually for getting job,16517.52,6.0
applications for roles for jobin so the,16520.879,4.56
data scientist page and then you put,16523.52,3.9
some information here and it validates,16525.439,3.241
and,16527.42,3.721
then you try to submit,16528.68,5.699
and then you get a response okay so play,16531.141,5.519
around with this it's the we've covered,16534.379,3.781
a lot of ground today so it's not,16536.66,4.92
something that you will immediately feel,16538.16,5.58
completely comfortable with and you may,16541.58,4.139
have to work through each step each step,16543.74,4.619
has a fair bit of depth in into it you,16545.719,4.201
may have to look up references for each,16548.359,3.721
step but if you can work through this,16549.92,3.84
entire tutorial just try to recreate,16552.08,4.799
this on your own then you've mostly,16553.76,5.699
learned a large part of what happens in,16556.879,5.101
web development and there was a question,16559.459,4.621
how will web development help me at my,16561.98,3.78
job I can only see it being used for,16564.08,3.299
making portfolio websites or personal,16565.76,4.199
projects right now well we've actually,16567.379,4.381
seen that some of the folks who have,16569.959,3.602
graduated from the boot camp and gone,16571.76,4.019
into a job have had this requirement,16573.561,4.5
where maybe they've created a plotly,16575.779,5.34
dashboard or maybe they have created,16578.061,4.978
some analysis and they need to put that,16581.119,2.942
up online,16583.039,2.941
so that other people in the company can,16584.061,4.5
see it so a couple of people have had to,16585.98,4.26
do this or maybe they have created a,16588.561,3.359
machine learning model and now they need,16590.24,3.539
to put create a web application so that,16591.92,3.06
people can interact with the machine,16593.779,3.061
learning model or maybe they need to,16594.98,3.299
offer the machine learning model as a,16596.84,4.14
rest API so that you can send data to,16598.279,4.44
the machine learning model and get a,16600.98,3.42
response back and if that sounds,16602.719,4.08
familiar that's very simple very similar,16604.4,4.44
to The Post form response that we looked,16606.799,4.381
at right so there are a lot of areas,16608.84,4.14
it's not something that you'd probably,16611.18,4.14
be doing in the first six months to one,16612.98,5.581
year of your role as a data analyst,16615.32,5.58
but in case you need to,16618.561,6.298
you always have this and web development,16620.9,5.819
of course is always a good skill to have,16624.859,4.321
because it just,16626.719,5.461
90 percent of what you do on a computer,16629.18,5.099
is happening on the web and now you have,16632.18,5.4
the power to create that we've covered a,16634.279,5.461
large portion of what happens in web,16637.58,4.139
development this is what we do all day,16639.74,3.901
at jobin essentially when we're building,16641.719,4.021
the platform there are a few more things,16643.641,4.019
as mentioned in the future work like,16645.74,3.719
creating an admin login interface,16647.66,4.199
allowing admins to Mark applications and,16649.459,4.5
creating a user login which will just,16651.859,4.202
make this a full-fledged web application,16653.959,4.92
that you can then start promoting and,16656.061,4.558
start getting users for,16658.879,4.32
so I hope you found this interesting and,16660.619,5.041
I know it's challenging but give it some,16663.199,5.34
time and I hope you'll enjoy building,16665.66,4.68
your own websites,16668.539,4.74
congrats on making it to the of this,16670.34,5.879
long and detailed tutorial I hope you,16673.279,4.801
were able to follow along and build your,16676.219,5.461
own website share like subscribe and,16678.08,6.379
I'll see you next time,16681.68,2.779
