# Question 1:
# Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
# Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
# Following are the fixed values of C and H:
# C is 50. H is 30.
# D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated
# sequence.
# Example
# Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
# 100,150,180
# The output of the program should be:
# 18,22,24
# c=50
# h=30
# # d = 1
# d = input("Enter the Values: ")
# numbers = d.split(",")
# ans = []
# for d in numbers:
#     form = ((2*c*int(d))/h)**0.5
#     ans.append(str(int(form)))
# print(",".join(ans))













# Question 2:
# Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The
# element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
# Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1.
# Example
# Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
# 3,5
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

# map
# inputs = input("Enter the values").split(",")
# f = inputs[0]
# s = inputs[1]
# ans = []
# for i in range(f):
#     row = []
#     for j in range(s):
#         row.append(i*j)
#     ans.append(row)
# print(ans)







# Question 3:
# Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the
# words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# without,hello,bag,world
# Then, the output should be:
# bag,hello,without,world

# st = input("Enter the Comma Seperated words: ").split(",")
# st.sort()
# print(",".join(st))


# Question 4:
# Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints
# the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.

# hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
# Then, the output should be:
# again and hello makes perfect practice world

# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# hello world! 123
# Then, the output should be:
# LETTERS 10
# DIGITS 3
# st = input("Enter the phrase: ")
# Letters = 0
# Digits = 0
# for i in st:
#     if i.isalpha() == True:
#         Letters += 1
#     elif i.isnumeric() == True:
#         Digits += 1

# print("DIGITS ",Digits)




# Question 6:
# A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to
# check the validity of password input by users.
# Following are the criteria for checking the password:
# 1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
# 2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
# 1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
# 3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
# 4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
# 5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
#
# Example
# If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
# ABd1234@1,
# a F1#,
# 2w3E*,
# 2We3345
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# True or False
